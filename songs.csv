"Well, you hoot and you holler and you make me mad  
And I've always been under your heel  
Holy christ what a lousy deal  
Now I'm sick and tired of your tedious ways  
And I ain't gonna take it no more  
Oh no no - walkin' out that door  
  
Burning my bridges, cutting my tie  
Once again I wanna look into the eye  
Being myself  
Counting my pride  
No un-right neighbour's gonna take me for a ride  
Burning my bridges  
Moving at last  
Girl I'm leaving and I'm burying the past  
Gonna have peace now  
You can be free  
No one here will make a sucker out of me

"I'm down and I feel depressed  
Sitting here just waiting  
For next bus travelling  
Downtown  
It's a crying shame  
Isn't it  
The beautiful weather  
If I could have my way  
Well, I would not be working  
On a day like this I know what I'd like to be  
As free as a bumble bee  
Take a sip from  
Every flower  
Free as a bumble bee  
While away each lazy hour  
What a good life  
Lying laid back  
Like an old railroad bum by the track  
What a good life  
Living outdoors  
Lie in the grass and chew on a straw

"Just a notion that's all  
Just a feeling that you're watchin' me  
Every move I'm making  
Am I reading your mind  
Cause it's almost like you're touching me  
There is no mistaking  
Just a notion  
That you'll be walkin' up to me  
In a while  
And you smile and say hello  
Then we'll be dancing through the night  
Knowing everything from there on  
Must be right  
  
Just a notion  
But somehow I know I'm not wrong  
If it's our destiny there's nothing we can do  
But tonight is very special  
It's the night for me and you

"The poster on the wall of a dear friend  
I wish there was a way that I could show you how your songs set me free  
The hero of them all  
You're a legend  
I guess I'll never get a chance to know you  
Still you're close as can be  
  
Make the bandstand to a dreamland, Rubber Ball Man  
Clapping your hands, let your feet dance, Rubber Ball Man  
When you're jumping up and down, nobody's standing still  
Some of us dreaming, some of us screaming  
Look at your fans, how we love you, Rubber Ball Man!

Then noticing 'twas connected to his head  
  
How strange, not to believed  
I reached out to feel, and the pony's eyes opened  
The cord got hard, the head looked around  
And you know who pushed and gushed  
The waters of life  
First two hooved feet, then the shine of his fur  
  
But at first to my eyes only  
Feather - feathers - wings

Would be all I found

Turned out questions in the end

And just like the sky

From what was to be

Learning to trust is just for children in school  
  
I fell in love with love one night when the moon was full  
I was unwise with eyes unable to see  
I fell in love with love, with love everlasting  
But love fell out with me  
  
Oh, I fell in love with love one night when the moon was full  
I was unwise with eyes unable to see  
I fell in love with love, with love everlasting  
But love fell out with me

"Hear the lonesome whippoorwill  
He sounds too blue to fly  
The midnight train is winding low  
I'm so lonesome I could cry  
  
I've never seen a night so long  
Where time goes crawling by  
The moon just went behind a cloud  
To hide its face and cry  
  
The silence of a falling star  
Lights up a purple sky  
And as I wonder where you are  
I'm so lonesome I could cry  
  
I'm so lonesome I could cry  
I'm so lonesome I could cry

"This is the night of love  
The shining hour of Kalua  
Her song is in the air  
Her lips are waiting there  
Who will be Kalua's only love?  
  
Who will her lover be?  
Who will her lover be?  
  
Before the night is old  
My arms will hold Kalua  
And where the trandewinds blow  
Soft and low  
  
Our love will blossom bright  
In the night  
And stars will sing above  
The love song of Kalua

"It seems we stood and talked like this before  
We looked at each other in the same way then  
But I can't remember where or when  
The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore  
  
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then  
But I can't remember where or when  
Some things that happened for the first time  
Seem to be happening again  
  
And so it seems that we have met before  
And laughed before, and loved before  
But who knows where or when

"Children of Abraham, what's your story?  
Killing each other for a piece of land  
Children of Abraham, this ain't glory  
You've got to walk together hand in hand  
  
Take down the flags that just separate the people  
Take down the wire on the boundary  
Take back the words that were spoken in anger  
You've got to live just like a family  
  
Children of Abraham,I must be dreaming  
Rivers of blood running through your hands  
Children crying, mothers screaming  
It just wasn't looking like the Promised Land

And now and then I don't feel lonely  
Now and then and only in my mind  
  
I want to go outside today go away, I think I'll stay  
Now and then I talk with you  
And now and then you turn me on  
Now and then and when I don't feel blue  
  
Maybe I could tell you now that I really love you

Say so long, now and forever then

If you only knew  
I'll be there with you  
It will make this farewell seem  
Little more than but a dream  
If you only knew  
Dreams are often true  
Someday I'll be there with you  
When you're there, I'll be there too  
If you only knew

What's it about, baby?  
You ask why  
Blues had to go and pick you  
So you go  
Down to the shore, kid's stuff  
Don't you know  
There's honey in the store for you, big stuff  
Let's take a ride on my gravy train  
The door open wide  
  
So you stare  
Call it despair, baby  
Don't you care  
I'm on the square about you

It maybe that you're my guy  
Let's take a ride on my gravy train

Come in from out of the rain

My sweet embraceable you  
Embrace me  
My irreplaceable you  
Just to look at you  
My heart grows tipsy in me  
You and you alone  
  
Bring out the gypsy in me  
  
I love all  
The many charms about you  
Above all  
I want my arms about you  
Don't be naughty baby  
Come to me  
Come to me do

Yes everybody's laughing  
They know that you and I are through  
And everybody's laughing  
  
I told the world you loved me  
And bragged about it proudly  
But since they know it's over  
They're laughing at me loudly.  
  
People love to linger  
So they can point a finger  
And tear apart a gal whose heart  
Was taken through the wringer  
  
It we could start all over  
The laugh might be on them  
But meanwhile  
Everybody's laughing

Sweetheart, my love is still untold  
A kiss that is never tasted  
Forever and ever is wasted  
  
For all we know, we may never meet again  
Before you go, make this moment sweet again  
We won't say, goodnight until the last minute  
I'll hold out my hand and my heart will be in it

We come and go like a ripple on a stream  
So love me tonight, tomorrow was made for some  
Tomorrow may never come, for all we know

"Forget if you can  
Romantic music one magical night  
A corner table in dim candle light  
A kiss that was heaven for two  
  
Forget if you can  
The day we hiked to where nobody knows  
The swell spaghetti at Tony and Joe's  
It hasn't been fun without you  
  
Don't you remember  
All the silly things we used to do  
The way we laughed  
When we were photographed  
As Handsome Hat and his ten-timing gal  
Why shouldn't we play  
More happy moments like we used to spend  
They were so perfect  
Too perfect to end  
Let your heart forget it you can

Just like a leaf that has blown away  
Gone with the wind  
My romance has flown away  
yesterday's kisses are still on my lips  
I had a lifetime of heaven at my fingertips  
now all is gone  
Gone is the rapture that filled my heart  
Gone with the wind  
The gladness that thrilled my heart  
just like a flame love burned brightly  
Then became an empty smoke dream  
That has gone with the wind

"Just when romance got a start  
You decided it was time to part  
How could you?

It was on a night like this  
You left me and didn't leave a kiss  
How could you?  
How could you?  
  
You know that love is just like apple pie  
It's either sweet or tart  
You could be the apple of my eye  
But you, you, you upset the apple cart  
  
I was looking forward to  
All those little things you didn't do  
How could you,  
Could you break my heart?

Guys have lost their meaning for me  
I'll never be the same  
Nothing's what it once used to be  
And when the song birds that sing  
Tell me it's spring, I can't believe their song  
Once love was king but kings can be wrong  
I'll never be the same  
There is such an ache in my heart  
I'll never be the same since we're apart  
But there's a lot that a smile can hide  
And I know deep down inside  
I'll never be the same, never be the same again

"My first impression of you  
Was like the sight of flowers in spring  
You were a glorious thing to see  
  
My first impression of you  
Was something indescribably new  
I stood there looking at you  
Smiling at me  
  
If you had stepped right out of heaven  
It wouldn't surprise me more  
I thought you were an angel  
From heaven's door  
  
It may sound silly, but true  
My heart just stopped  
When I caught your eye  
So overwhelming  
Was my first impression of you

"Once they called it ragtime  
And it had its fling  
It's the same old syncopation  
Now they call it swing  
  
Then they played it jazz time  
To a buck-and-wing  
Once again it sweeped the nation  
Now they call it swing  
  
When singers used to sing  
They would go hot cha  
But with this modern thing  
Now they go dru-do do, dra-da-da  
  
Rhythm has its seasons  
Summer, fall and spring  
But for seven silly reasons  
Someone pulled the string  
And they started dancing  
Now they call it swing

"One never knows, does one?  
When love will come along  
Then so suddenly life turns out to be a song  
  
One never knows, does one?  
The moment or the place  
Then right before your eyes  
Someone occupies your embrace  
  
Someday look and you'll find  
Two hearts were blest  
Someday fate may be kind  
Pray for the future  
Hope for the best  
One never knows, does one?  
  
That's just the way it goes  
All at once you hear  
""Hold me. Caress me""  
And then love may come  
But when, one never knows

How the words are spoken  
How to make the motions

My lonely days are over  
And life is like a song  
  
At last  
The skies above are blue  
My heart was wrapped in clover  
The night I looked at you  
  
And I found a dream that I can speak to  
A dream that I can call my own  
I found a thrill to press my cheek to  
A thrill that I have never known  
  
You smile  
And then the spell was cast  
And here we are in Heaven  
For you are mine at last

The stars in the sky looked down where he lay  
The little Lord Jesus, asleep on the hay  
  
The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,  
But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.  
I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky  
And stay by my cradle til morning is nigh.  
  
Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay  
Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.  
Bless all the dear children in thy tender care,  
And take us to heaven, to live with Thee there.

"You change just like the weather I never know if you'll be hot or cold to me  
Can't you see what I've been going through  
We belong together even though I know at times it just can't be  
Honey can't you see I'll always be a fool for you  
I'll always be the first to say I'm sorry I'll always be the last to say we're
through  
I'll always be the one to take another chance  
In this romance I'll always be a fool for you  
  
I'll always be the first to say  
I'll always be a fool for you

Making you happy's my desire dear loving you is my goal  
I'll forever love you the rest of my days I'll never part from you and your

"  
On a long lonesome journey I am going  
So my sweet little darling don't cry  
For in shackles and chains they will take me  
To a prison to live till I die  
(chorus)  
And each night threw the bars  
I will gaze at the stars  
My dreams dear of you so in vain  
A piece of stone I will use for my pillow  
While I'm sleeping in shackles and chains  
Put your arms threw these bars once more darling  
Let me kiss your sweet lips I love best  
For in sorrow they were my conculution  
And in sadness my haven of rest  
(repeat chorus)

Stay by my side

Meet someone  
In whom you'll confide

Life's still a dream  
Your love's amazing  
Since I found you  
My life's amazing  
  
I pledge you  
You'll never be blue  
There's too much at stake to be down  
  
My nightmare  
Rooted here watching you go  
Divine in both, our lives

My life's a roll  
Go go go  
And it's amazing

"New feeling inside  
It's a hot certain kind  
I feel hot and cold  
Down my soul, baby  
I can't explain  
Going out of my mind  
Dizzy in the head, and I'm feeling blue  
Things you say well maybe they're true  
I get funny dreams again and again  
Knows what it means, but  
Can't explain  
I think it's love  
Say it to you  
When I feel blue  
I can't explain, no, I can't explain  
You know I can't explain  
I'm going out of my mind  
Well I'm a worried guy  
But I can't explain

"And as the sparrow sings  
Dawn chorus for  
Someone else to hear  
The thinker sits alone growing older  
And so bitter  
She gave them life,  
She gave them all  
They drained her very soul dry...dry  
Hey hey hey bitter girl  
We're out to sitting here digging you  
We flew done here just to figure you  
It's easy  
Don't be so bitter  
Oh oh oh crazy girl  
You gave too much and you got nothing  
Too many problems and not one thing  
In return  
Left high and dry

And as the sun rise stream  
Flickers on  
She finds lavender  
To fight the beckoning

You saw me standing alone,  
Without a dream in my heart,  
Without a love of my own.

You knew just what I was there for.  
You heard me saying a pray for  
Someone I really could care for.

You saw me standing alone,  
Without a dream in my heart,  
Without a love of my own.

In the nighttime when I dream  
  
When I pass a garden fair  
And the scent is in the air

Once again I'll hold you tight  
Though you're gone your love lives on  
When moonlight beams

And if my prayers are answered, you are my only love  
Oh-oh, you mean everything to me, it's heaven, heaven  
All I want our love to be is heaven, heaven

Her tiny hand was locked in his, two hearts beatin' a chord  
Two young lovers like you and I  
With young love that just won't die  
They stopped to pick a pebble, each one must make a wish  
They cast them out into the blue and sealed it with a kiss  
They stood beneath an elmtree, carved initials in a heart  
And pledged to undying love, which only death could part

With young love that just won't die  
Just won't die, will not die, never die

Oh Willa Mae, yeah I love you more everyday  
They say that love is blind, but they did not know your kind

Alone, alone, my lonely heart does ponder

Smoke cigarettes and drink coffee too  
You're the reason I don't sleep at night  
I'm bettin' you're not losin' sleep over me  
But if I'm wrong, don't fail to call  
Come over and keep me company

Strum my guitar and sing out a tune

Did you see him run through the streets and far way?

Did his life flash by on the bedroom door?  
  
Did you hear the news came across the air today?

Did you see him hide? Did you see him crawl?

Did you catch his face, was it 10538?

Whoa i heard a robin sing  
About a nest... apart  
All that you seem to be  
End up in harmony  
Zing went the strings of my heart  
  
I still recall the thrill  
I guess i always will  
I hope we'll never depart

April in Paris, this is a feeling  
  
That no one can ever reprise

Whom can I run to  
What have you done to my heart

Although the road was long  
I thought that i was strong  
And now the saddest song is passed

The beggars can't be choosers

A new room for two room  
Where every day's a holiday  
Because you're married to me.  
  
Not like a ballroom  
A small room, a hall room  
Where I can smoke my pipe away  
With your wee head upon my knee.  
  
We will thrive on, keep alive on  
Just nothing but kisses  
With mister and missus  
On little blue chairs.  
  
You sew your trousseau  
And Robinson Crusoe  
Is not so far from worldly cares  
As our blue room far away upstairs!

Hi ho, alas, and also lackaday  
Although I can't dismiss  
The memory of his kiss  
I guess he's not for me

I long for somebody who  
Will sympathize with me

I lie awake all night and cry  
Nobody loves me  
That's why  
  
All by myself in the morning  
All by myself in the night  
I sit alone with a table and a chair  
So unhappy there  
Playing solitaire  
  
All by myself I get lonely  
Watching the clock on the shelf  
I'd love to rest my weary head on somebody's shoulder  
I hate to grow older  
All by myself

To see all that lies beyond  
If you just believe in fairyland

Why wish me harm  
Why not retire to a farm  
And be contented to charm  
The birds off the trees  
  
Just disappear  
I care for you much too much  
And when you're near, close to me dear  
We touch too much  
  
The thrill when we meet is so bittersweet

So on your mark get set  
Get out of town

And trouble begins to brew  
Whenever the winter winds  
Begin to blow

When fortune cries nay, nay to me  
And people declare ""you're through""  
Whenever the blues becomes my only song  
I concentrate on you  
  
On your smile to sweet so tender  
When first my kiss you deny  
On the love in your eyes  
When you surrender  
And once again our arms intertwine  
  
And so when wise men say to me  
That loves young dreams never come true  
To prove that even wise men can be wrong  
I concentrate on you

Keeps draggin' my poor (old) heart around  
All I see, for me is - misery  
I gotta right to sing the blues  
I gotta right to moan and sigh  
I gotta right to sit and cry  
Down around the river

I gotta right to sing the blues

"Imagination is funny  
It makes a cloudy day sunny  
Makes a bee think of honey

Starts you asking a daisy  
What to do, what to do?  
  
Have you ever felt  
A gentle touch and then a kiss  
And then and then  
Find it's only your imagination again? Oh, well

For example I go around wanting you  
And yet I can't imagine that you want me too

Where you get to the stage, where you're not even tired  
Kicking your heels till the time comes around  
To pick up your bags and head out of town  
  
Slow down, Joe, I'm a rock-and-roll man

"I was always, baby, I was always  
Well almost always true to you  
Met a pretty mademoiselle  
Her papa owned a small hotel  
Oh, I was almost always true to you  
  
I resisted tho' my arm was twisted  
I was almost always true to you  
Stayed away from drinkin' wine  
Thought about you all the time  
Oh, I was almost always true to you

I would never steal a kiss  
Oh, I was almost always true to you

No light from angel eyes

Just with a phrase you're turning  
Since hearts ever have been yearning......... and so alone

"Intonation  
The title ""As Baile"" can be translated as ""away from home"".  
The song itself is all intonation, although you might say the intonation is
""based"" in Irish Gaelic. Enya sings ""or, horo, mo-ray he u way, he u way"" and
so on. The word ""or"" is an interjection that could be translated as ""oh!"" or
""oho!"", but the rest of the song is intonation.

I would rather die of starvation,  
Perish out in the desert sun,  
I would rather die of starvation,  
Perish out in the desert sun,  
Than to think of some other man  
Holding you in his arms.  
  
My heart gets so heavy  
Lord I shakes down in my bones.  
My heart gets so heavy,  
Lord I shakes down in my bones.  
I can't hurt a murderer,  
Oh Lord, but I'm forced to weep and moan.

"High upon a mountain top  
Where the eagle builds his nest  
I shall go wandering,  
Trying to put my mind at rest,  
And I shall never cease  
Until the day I die.  
  
He was once a friend of mine,  
But I did not know or care  
Until she said goodbye.  
I cried till I could hardly see  
The meaning of my life.  
What do I do now?  
  
High upon a mountain top  
Where the eagle builds his nest  
I shall go wandering,  
Trying to put my mind at rest,  
And I shall never cease  
Until the day I die.

Always change my mind.

Just when I thought it was over, you come back  
And I'm hung up on your love again.  
Just when I thought I was free, you come back.  
Now I'm hung up on your love again.  
  
Just as I was doing good,  
You come back, just to prove you could.  
Things will always be the same,  
With me the victim of the game.

"There was a wicked messenger  
From Eli he did come  
With a mind that multiplied  
The smallest matter  
When questioned who had sent for him  
He answered with a thumb  
For his tongue it could not speak  
But only flatter  
He stayed behind the assembly hall  
It was there that he made his bed  
Often times he could be seen returning  
Until one day he just appeared  
With a note in his hand which read

Sings like a Motown melody  
It dreams like California  
Bigger than a Texas sky  
It bleeds, it scorns, but it shines when times get hard  
You can't break an American heart  
  
She's up before the sun, on the run  
Another dollar another day another cup of coffee  
Thank you Lord  
For giving me one more  
She still leans on her dreams but it seems  
Sometimes she's the only one who still believes that life is hard  
So she takes it on with an American heart

"A little dream castle, with every dream gone  
Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn  
And my heart is heavy, as I gaze upon a cottage for sale.  
The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay  
  
A beautiful garden has withered away  
Where you planted roses, the weeds seem to say, A cottage for sale  
From every single window, I see your face  
But when I reach the window, there's empty space  
  
The key's in the mailbox, the same as before  
But no one is waiting for me anymore  
The end of our story is there on the door, A cottage for sale

"Yesterday we were gay,  
I was high on a rainbow, but now there's no rainbow,  
You've gone, and so a lover is blue  
Life was sweet, so complete,  
Now I've suddenly waken to find I'm forsaken,  
Alone, and so a lover is blue  
Do you still remember our love affair,  
Does it matter to you,  
But I'll have to go through our door to care  
Here and there everywhere,  
Every scene just reminds me  
Of something that binds me  
To you, and so a lover is blue

"The likes of you may never be attracted to the likes of me,  
But accidents will happen and I'll be around,  
And maybe there'll be no one else but me around.  
Forevermore may never start, you may ignore my hopeful heart,  
And chances are not the one to make you fall,  
But accidents will happen after all.  
A smile may show it, your eyes may glow  
Before you know it, I'm sure I'll know.  
So if you fall in just that way, oh wouldn't I be thrilled to hear you say  
I had a lovely accident today.  
Your eyes may glow, I'm sure I'll know.

"Give me an old fashioned Christmas, an old fashioned Christmas  
Family faces, wide open spaces, covered with snow  
Right now my mom there in the kitchen, basting the Christmas bird  
You'll have to take my word, you can't find that at the automat  
An old fashioned fireplace, give me an old fashioned fireplace  
My heart remembers smoldering embers, warming your glow  
I'd trade that whole Manhattan skyline, the shimmering steel and chrome  
For one old fashioned Christmas back home

",Frank Sinatra
"You could leave tomorrow, fly to Mandalay, darling I would love you anyway,  
I just couldn't help but care, anytime, anywhere.  
You can keep me waiting every single day, I'll be there to meet you anyway,  
You make life a love affair, anytime, anywhere.  
  
Why should I lie and pretend I don't belong to you,  
Why even try when it makes no difference what you do, I'll be true.  
Take my heart completely, treat me as you may, I am yours forever anyway,  
All I have is yours to share, anytime, anyplace, anywhere.

Where there is laughter, there is Barbara, always Barbara warm and gay.

There's no one just like her, like Barbara, only Barbara is so rare.  
Wherever she is, I'll be there.

Or it's quiet or it's mad,  
It's a good thing or it's bad,  
But beautiful!  
  
Beautiful to take a chance  
And if you fall, you fall,  
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.  
Love is tearful or it's gay.  
It's a problem or it's play,  
It's a heartache either way,

I'd never let you go,  
And that would be but beautiful I know.

"The world is full of people, but none like you,  
They're ordinary people, but none like you.  
How far away is yesterday before you came along.  
It seemed to be just a dream to me, until you proved here on.  
The lanes are full of lovers, but none like you,  
  
Just ordinary lovers, not dreams like you,  
I shut my eyes to realize this grand surprise is true,  
That I'm the lucky one who found you.

You have danced with him since the music began.

Must you dance quite so close with your lips touching his face?  
Can't you see  
I'm longing to be in his place?  
Won't you change partners and dance with me?  
Ask him to sit this one out. while you're alone,  
I'll tell the waiter to tell him he's wanted on the telephone.

Day by day you're making all my dreams come true  
So, come what may, I want you to know

And dear heart, I want you to know  
I'll leave your arms never more

And then the cows came home, do you know why?  
We use to say we'll love this way, till Hades freezes over,  
And then it just froze over, do you know why?  
  
We thought we had a future dancing a jig for us,  
Do you suppose our little dream got too big for us  
We use to say our love will stay,  
Forever and a night, and now forevers gone,  
Darling, do you know why? Neither do I.

As he tiptoes across the sand  
He's got a million kinds of stardust  
Pick you fav'right brand, and  
  
Dream, when you're feeling blue  
Dream, that's the thing to do  
Just watch the smoke rings rise in the air  
You'll find your share of memories there  
  
So dream when the day is through  
Dream, and they might come true  
Things never are as bad as they seem  
So dream, dream, dream

Out of reach and out of touch  
When you came to me  
I found it could never be

When it's real  
Not pretend

"Darkest deep brown eyes I've seen  
Angel came into my dream  
Like the morning's early light  
You freshen all around  
And with all the love you bring unknown delight  
  
Sweetest innocence and free  
God has given you the key  
To the hearts of everyone  
That comes in sight of you  
And with all the love you bring unknown delight  
  
Who have eyes will clearly see  
And no one could disagree  
A treasure of the world  
A child, watching it grow  
And with all the love will bring unknown delight

"When every song is sung  
When every bells been rung  
When every pictures hung up  
Ill still love you  
  
When every wind has blown  
When every seed is sown  
When everything is known  
Then Ill still love you  
  
You know Ill love you, yes I will  
You know that Ill love you  
Love you, love you, yes I will  
  
You know I love you, yes I do  
When times get too hard  
You know Ill be there loving you  
  
When every soul is free  
When every eye can see  
When people all agree  
Then Ill still love you

"Amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now I'm found was blind but now I see  
  
Twas grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears relived  
How precious did that grace appear the hour I first believed  
  
Through many dangers toils and snares I have already come  
Tis grace that has brought me safe thus far and grace will lead me on  
  
When we've been there ten thousand years bright shining as the sun  
We've no less days to sing God's praise than when we first begun  
And than when we first begun

As I read the lines that to me were so sweet I remember our faded love  
I miss you darling more and more every day as heaven would miss the stars
above  
With every heartbeat I still think of you and remember our faded love  
  
I think of the past and all the pleasures we've had as I watch the mating of
the dove  
It was in the springtime that you said goodbye I remember our faded love

Magnifying love betrayed.

Just one way to say, I love you.

The day when you'll say, I love you.

"Let's take an old fashioned walk, I'm just bursting with talk.  
What a tale could be told if we went for an old fashioned walk.  
Let's take a stroll through the park, down a lane where it's dark  
And a heart that's controlled, may relax on an old fashioned walk.  
I know for a couple who seem to be miles apart,  
There's nothing like walking and having a ""heart to heart.""  
I know a girl who declined, couldn't make up her mind.  
She was wrapped up and sold, coming home from an old fashioned walk.

"[Verse:]  
There's a gleam in your eyes, Marie  
And the meaning is plain to see

That is not all it seems to be  
[Refrain:]  
Marie, the dawn is breaking  
Marie, you'll soon be waking  
To find your heart is aching  
And tears will fall as you recall  
The moon in all its splendor  
The kiss so very tender  
The words, ""Will you surrender  
To me, Marie?""

"Maybe it's because the kiss you gave me, touched my heart and went right
through.  
I can't tell you why, I only know that I fell helplessly in love with you.  
How I fell in love with you!  
I could say you're grand and therefore I care for you so.  
But there is a why and wherefore and I'd like to know.  
Maybe it's because the star I wished on, made a certain wish come true.  
Or it just should be that you were meant for me, and maybe I was meant for
you.  
Maybe it's because the song we danced to, told a story old and new.  
I can't figure out just why it came about.

"All the world's great lovers have been glorified  
History placed them in a romantic set  
In between book covers they are side by side  
But the real thing hasn't been written yet

Told in all it's glory  
Now that we have met  
The world may know the sentimental story  
  
The greatest romance they ever knew  
Is waiting to  
Unfold  
  
Now it can be told  
As an inspiration  
Every other tale  
Of boy meets girl is just an imitation  
  
The great love story  
Has never been told before  
But now  
Now it can be told

Come drumming and footsteps  
Like out of a dream  
Where the golden green waters come in  
  
Just nine lucky soldiers had come  
Through the night  
Half of them wounded  
And barely alive  
Just nine out of twenty was headed for home  
With eleven sad stories to tell  
  
I remember quite clearly when I got out of bed  
I said, oh, good morning what a beautiful day  

",James Taylor
"Did you think I'd stand there  
While you kicked me in the face  
Doesn't make much sense to push me down  
I need explanation to adjust my way of thought  
Did you think you'd find me hanging round  
And it's ten years later and I haven't left your side  
Even though you gave me reason to  
And I'm standing over your body's losing life  
I guess things are hard to name a few  
Did you think I'd take it when you pushed me in disgrace  
Very hard to leave that behind  
I hate aggravation but that's why you made me fight  
Have to face it you were just high.

"He brings a tear into my eyes  
When I begin, Lord, to realize.  
If you don't think that, honey, you'll be lonesome,  
You know I'll drown, drown, oh Lord, in my own tears.  
  
I know it's true into his mind  
A little rain is bound to fall  
But since you been gone honey I'm so blue,  
It just keeps rainin', keeps right on rainin' more and more.  
  
I didn't cry just like a child,  
My poor tears, Lord, they were runnin' wild.  
If you don't think that baby you'll be home soon now  
You know I'll drown, drown, oh Lord in my own tears.

"Sometimes I think about our good old high school days  
You would always kid about my adolescent ways  
Oh, Mary, Mary, good to see you too  
Haven't seen to many of the old crew  
The time just flew, and how are you?  
  
Strange we should meet here  
Seeing off our friends  
It's hard to draw the line between  
Beginnings and ends  
Oh, Mary, Mary, must you go so soon?  
We must be a sight to see  
Salon and saloon  
I'll look you up soon  
Maybe sing you a tune

"I should of quit you  
A long time ago  
I should of quit you baby

If I don't fallow pretty baby

"Once upon a time you dressed so fine  
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you  
Peopled called you, said 'beware the doll, you're bound to fall',  
You thought they were all kidding you  
You used to laugh about  
Everybody else that was hanging out  
Now you don't talk so loud  
Now you don't seem so proud  
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal  
  
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
To be on your own  
In no direction home  
Like a complete unknown  
Like a rolling stone

Lord knows she was good to me in every way

A real woman  
Lord, she gave me lovin' both night and day  
My sun shine  
Whoo hoo  
For my woman  
Or else or else  
Its going to take me one more day  
If it takes me  
She went way down in Dallas  
Way down in Texas land  
Lord she had me wrapped around her wrist and around her finger baby  
Like a ring wrapped around a finger of a severed hand  
I'm lookin' for my Dallas honey bee  
Who can you be  
Who can you be  
Oooh hoo hoo help me  
Help me look for her  
Oh yeah

"In Amerigo, Carnival was as hallowed as Christmas itself, perhaps slightly
more  
So.  
There was a meaning to it. See, Islanders did not put into words, yet which  
Made it the authentic supreme day in the Kinjian calendar.  
  
Africa was marching down the main street of this little harbor town today.  
  
Africa, in undimmed black vitality, surging up out of centuries of island  
Displacement, island slavery, island isolation, island ignorance.  
  
Africa, unquenchable in its burning love of life.  
  
Carnival was Africa Day in Amerigo.

"Maybe leaving's better in the afternoon  
When the rain don't fall so hard  
From where we were we had to look down far below  
To see just what went on in our own backyard  
  
Coming down slow without a thing to show  
Wondering what went on while we were up there  
Mountain roads now asphalt highways  
That we once called heaven skyways  
Children lost what is the cost to get back home again

Such a high Cumberland Jubilee

has been released on.  
  
  
Casey Jones he was a mighty man  
But now he's resting in the promised land  
The only thing he could understand  
Was an eight wheel driver under his command  
He made the freight train boogie  
All the time  
He made the freight train boogie  
As he rolled down the line  
  
Whoo whoo, wah wah  
Whoo whoo, wah wah  
Whoo whoo, wah wah  
Whoo whoo, wah wah  
He made the freight train boggle  
As he rolled down the line

"We were live on arrival  
Safe home at last  
No cannon fire dockside  
No flags half-mast  
  
We were sold out for silver  
And a string of black pearls  
On the loneliest island  
At the edge of the world  
  
Like destiny's children  
Souls lost at sea  
No room on the lifeboat  
You can hold on to me  
  
Now the voyage is over  
We're back on dry land  
In our eyes are the stories  
The rope and the brand

Souls lost at sea  
No room on the lifeboat  
You can hold on to me

"I remember romance  
Bubblebaths at night  
Breakfast in the afternoon  
Love by candlelight  
Love by candlelight  
  
I remember romance  
And lying in her arms  
Her hair across my shoulder  
Her breast upon my arm  
Her breast upon my arm  
  
I remember romance  
And laughing at the moon  
Dancing at the rainbow's end  
And losing her too soon  
And losing her too soon  
  
I know we both are sorry  
I know we both still care  
Oh how could we have lost it  
A love beyond compare  
A love beyond compare

Come walking through the evening air  
And I believe that you can make me feel better  
And I believe that you might always be there  
I want to move out of town  
And follow the sound  
And lay it all down  
  
Darling do you know I've been lonely  
Darling do you know I've been bad  
Darling do you know I've been lied to

In all the old, familiar places,  
That this heart of mine embraces,  
All day through.  
  
In that small cafe,  
The park across the way,  
The children's carousel,  
The chestnut tree,  
The wishing well.  
  
Ill be seeing you,  
In every lovely, summers day,  
And everything that's bright and gay,  
Ill always think of you that way,  
Ill find you in the morning sun,  
And when the night is new,  
Ill be looking at the moon,  
But I'll be seeing you.

"The harp that once : to oombayga and family  
  
The harp that once through tara's halls  
The soul of music shed  
Now hangs as mute on tara's walls  
As if that soul were fled  
So sleeps the pride of former days  
So glory's thrill is o'er  
And the hearts that once beat high for praise  
Now feel that pulse no more  
No more to chiefs and ladies bright  
The harp of tara swells  
The chord alone that breaks at night  
Its tale of ruin tells  
Thus freedom now so seldom wakes  
The only throb she gives  
Is when some heart indignant breaks  
To show that still she lives

Dear thoughts are in my mind  
And my soul soars enchanted  
As I hear the sweet lark sing  
In the clear air of the day  
For a tender beaming smile  
To my hope has been granted  
And tomorrow she shall hear  
All my fond heart would say  
I should tell her all my love  
All my soul's adoration  
And I think she will hear me  
And will not say me nay  
It is this that gives my soul  
All it's joyous elation

That we just didn't have a lot to say

Not knowing where to go  
Just to pass the time away  
Before we held our show  
I heard a little mission band  
Playing with all their might  
I gave my soul to Jesus  
And left the show that night  
The day will soon be over  
And evening will begone  
No more gems to be gathered  
So let us all press on  
When Jesus comes to claim us  
And says it is enough  
The diamonds will be shining  
No longer in the rough

Last chance lost

Blame takes aim

And she aims at the streetlight  
While the freeway hisses  
Dogs bark as the gun falls to the floor  
The streetlight's still burning,  
She always misses  
But the day she hits  
That's the day she'll leave  
That one little victory, that's all she needs!

Rule with iron hand  
And prove to all the world  
Metal rules the land  
We're heavy duty  
So come on let's tell the world  
  
We are defenders of the faith

"Where do we go from here  
There must be something near  
Changing you, changing me forever  
Places changes, faces change  
Life is so very strange  
Changing time, changing rhyme together  
There's no where else to go  
This could be our last show  
Changing dreams, changing schemes never  
We are never satisfied  
Love is gone, along with fun  
Now we're reaching for the gun  
Changing cast, changing fast, no more tether  
We are never satisfied  

",Judas Priest
"The winds of change are everywhere  
And all the world must be aware  
There's nowhere left for man to go  
The sands of time are running low  
  
These visions fall before my face  
I see the end of humans race  
These feelings rise inside my soul  
And everything's out of control  
  
The winds of change (Repeat 2X)  
Are in the air (Repeat 2X)  
The winds of change (Repeat 2X)  
Are everywhere

"Now when the day goes to sleep and the full moon looks,  
And the night is so black that the darkness cooks,  
And you come creeping around, making me do things I don't want to do.  
Can't believe that she needs my love so bad.  
Come sneaking around, trying to drive me mad.  
Busting in all my dreams, making me see things I don't want to see.  
  
'Cause you're the Green Manalishi with the two-pronged crown  
All night dragging us up, or you're bringing us down  
Just taking my love, and slip away  
Leaving me here, trying to keep from following you

",Judas Priest
"From a fireball we came crossed sea and mountain  
We were drinking beauty with our eyes  
We were given all to make our own  
Let us be left alone  
  
Laid the tasks and paid the price  
Everything survives  
Crushed and bolted all the grain  
At every wind what a stake we're in  
Is pain better than the grave  
  
When we talk without amend  
We see red and then  
Deep inside our blood begins to boil  
Like a tiger in the cage  
We begin to shake with rage

Ooh, I'm missin' you  
I've got those bye-bye, bye-bye baby blues  
Ooh ain't much to do  
Just sing those bye-bye, bye-bye baby blues  
  
Havin' the blues, hatin' to loose  
Guess I got a lot to learn  
All of my friends have lost now and then  
I guess it's just my turn

This is my philosophy  
To see me through the day  
To scare my cares away

All God's Chillun got swing  
Maybe haven't got money  
Maybe haven't got shoes  
All God's Chillun Got Rhythm  
For to push away the blues  
Yeah !  
  
All God's Chillun got trouble  
Trouble don't mean a thing

Troubles bound to go 'way, say!

"What a day this has been!  
What a rare mood I'm in!  
Why, it's almost like being in love  
  
There's a smile on my face  
For the whole human race  
Why it's almost like being in love  
  
All the music of life seems to be  
Like a bell that is ringing for me  
And from the way that I feel  
When the bell starts to peal  
I would swear I was falling  
I could swear I was falling  
It's almost like being in love

"Alone,  
Alone with a sky of romance above.  
Alone,  
Alone on a night that was meant for love.  
  
There must be someone waiting  
Who feels the way I do.  
Whoever you are, are you, are you  
  
Alone,  
Alone on this night that we two could share.  
Alone,  
Alone with a kiss that could make me care.  
  
And when you come I promise  
To be your very own!  
Alone,  
Alone with a heart meant for you.  
  
And when you come I promise  
To be your very own!  
Alone,  
Alone with a heart meant for you.

"Alone together, beyond the crowd  
Above the world  
We're not too proud to cling together  
We're strong as long as we're together  
  
Alone together, the blinding rain  
The starless nights were not in vain  
For we're together  
And what is there to fear together  
  
Our love is as deep as the sea  
Our love is as great as a love can be  
And we can weather the great unknown  
If we're alone together, together, together  
If we're alone together

"There's nothing left for me of days that used to be  
There's just a memory among my souvenirs  
  
Some letters tied in blue, a photograph or two  
I see a rose from you among my souvenirs  
  
A few more tokens rest within my treasure chest  
And though they do their best to give me consolation  
  
I count them all apart and as the teardrops start  
I find a broken heart among my souvenirs  
  
I count them all apart and as the teardrops start  
I find a broken heart among my souvenirs

I didn't want to do it

You made me happy sometimes  
You made me glad  
But there were times  
Dear, you made me feel so bad  
You made me sigh for

I didn't want to tell you  
I want some love that's true  
Yes I do, deed I do  
You know I do  
Give me, give me

You know you made me love you

He's got a smile that makes the lilac wanta grow  
He's got a way that makes the angels heave a sigh  
When they know little Joe's passing by  
  
Sometimes the cabin's gloomy and the table's bare  
Then he'll kiss me and it's Christmas everywhere  
Troubles fly away and life is easy go  
Does he love me good, that's all I need to know  
  
Seems like happiness, is just a thing called Joe

Let your heart be light  
Next year all our troubles will be  
Out of sight  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Make the yule-tide gay  
Next year all our troubles will be  
Miles away  
Once again as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who were dear to us  
Will be near to us once more  
Someday soon, we all will be together  
If the Fates allow  
Until then, we'll have to muddle through somehow  
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now.

"I love a piano, I love a piano.  
I love to hear somebody play upon a piano, a grand piano.  
It simply carries me away.  
I know a fine way to treat a Steinway.  
I love to run my fingers o'er the keys, the ivories.  
And with the pedal I love to meddle.  
When Padarewski comes this way.  
I'm so delighted if I'm invited to hear a long haired genius play.  
So you can keep your fiddle and bow.  
Give me a p-I-a-n-o o o.  
I love to stop right beside an upright,  
Or a high toned baby grand.

That trip to heaven 'till the dance is through,  
With no one else do the heavens seem quite so near,  
Why does it happen dear,  
Only with you?  
  
Two cheeks together can be so divine,  
But only when those cheeks are yours and mine,  
I've danced with dozens of others the whole night through,  
But the thrill that comes with spring when anything could happen,  
That only happens with you.

"Little drops of rain  
Little grains of sand  
Make the mighty ocean  
And the pleasant land  
  
Little notes that sing  
Little words that rhyme  
Make the mighty memories  
And the dreams of time  
  
Never let a minute  
Lie there on the shelf  
For there may be in it  
All loves life itself  
  
Little smiles of hope  
Little drops of tears  
Make this thing called love  
Go dancing down the years  
  
Little drops of rain  
Little rays of sun  
Make the hopeful rainbow  
Glow for everyone

Have a very, very merry Christmas.  
Dream about your hearts desire,  
Christmas Eve when you retire,  
Santa Claus will stop and I know he'll drop  
Exactly what you wanted from your chimney top.  
So be jolly,  
Have a holiday as gay as holly.  
May the ones you love be near you  
With the laugh of friends to cheer you.

Like the angels sing,  
And you hear the joyful hymn they chime,  
Hang a wish from me on your Christmas tree

For a very merry Christmas time.

When you croon, croon a tune from the heart of Dixie.  
Just place my cradle, mammy mine,  
Right on the Mason Dixon line,  
And swing it from Virginia  
To Tennessee with all the love that's in ya.  
  
Weep no more, my lady.  
Sing that song again for me.  
Soft and low, just as though  
You had me on your knee.

If you would only sing that Swanee River.  
Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye baby with a Dixie melody

San Francisco  
Open your golden gate  
You let no stranger wait outside your door

Here is your wandering one  
Saying I'll wander no more  
Other places only make me love you best

It's sweetness both princes and peasants may calim,

No matter the language the song is the same.  
  
Go to sleep, my baby, go to sleep,  
While the stars above begin to peep,  
They're lighting the windows of heaven, angels watch over you.  
From the windows of heaven, mother's watching you too.

From the windows of heaven, mother's watching you too.  
  
Sleep, my baby, sleep.

Why do I try to draw you near me?  
Why do I cry? You never hear me

You lie awake and think about the girl  
And never even think of counting sheep  
When your lonely heart has learned its lesson  
You'd be hers if only she would call  
In the wee small hours of the morning  
That's the time you miss her most of all  
When your lonely heart has learned its lesson  
You'd be hers if only she would call  
And in the wee small hours of the morning  
That's the time you missed her most of all

"Just one more day I ask  
One chance to love you  
I can see your face  
Everywhere I go  
It's in my soul.  
No matter how it goes  
God only knows  
I get more than I deserve  
Yes, it's such an easy word  
Give me one more day.  
And time  
Is a river that rows us along  
And love will deliver us  
If we hold on.  
So if you think  
You might not trust your heart tonight  
I'm never gonna drift away  
I'll wait forever if you say  
You'll give me one more day.  
And time...

Holy Infant  
So tender and mild

Glory streams from heaven above  
Heavenly hosts sing Hallelujah

Radiant beams from thy holy face

"Grass in your hair stretched like a lion in the sun  
Restlessly turned moistened your mouth with your tongue.  
Pouring my wine in your eyes caged mine glowing  
Touching your face my fingers strayed knowing.  
I called you lady of the dancing water.  
  
Blown autumn leaves shed to the fire where you laid me  
Burn slow to ash just as my days now seem to be.  
I feel you still always your eyes glowing  
Remembered hours salt, earth and flowers flowing  
Farewell my lady of the dancing water.

"One eye goes laughing,  
One eye goes crying  
Through the trials and trying of one life  
One hand is tied,  
One step gets behind  
In one breath we're dying  
  
I've been waiting for the sun to come up  
Waiting for the showers to stop  
Waiting for the penny to drop  
One time  
  
And I've been standing in a cloud of plans  
Standing on the shifting sands  
Hoping for an open hand  
One time

"Peace is a word  
Of the sea and the wind  
Peace is a bird who sings  
As you smile  
Peace is the love  
Of a foe as a friend  
Peace is the love you bring  
To a child  
  
Searching for me  
You look everywhere  
Except beside you  
Searching for you  
You look everywhere  
But not inside you  
  
Peace is a stream  
From the heart of a man  
Peace is a man, whose breadth  
Is the dawn  
Peace is a dawn  
On a day without end  
Peace is the end, like death  
Of the war

That if I were truly to be myself, I would break my family's heart  
  
Who is that girl I see  
Staring straight, back at me  
Why is my reflection someone I don't know  
Somehow I cannot hide, who I am  
Though I've tried.  
When will my reflection show who I am inside.  
  
When will my reflection show who I am inside.

"You will always be a special part of me  
You will always be a special memory  
I'll always cherish wonderful moments  
You have given me  
You are in my heart wherever I may be  
  
All the times we shared will always be to me  
Songs my heart will sing refreshing melodies  
I'll put together all of your laughter  
Like a symphony  
I'll remember you wherever I may be

Where is love?  
Does it fall from skies above?  
Is it underneath the willow tree  
That I've been dreaming of?  
  
Where is she?  
Who I close my eyes to see?  
Will I ever know the sweet hello  
That's meant for only me?  
  
Who can say where she may hide  
Must I travel far and wide  
'til I am beside  
That someone who  
I can mean something to?  
Where... Where... Is love?  
  
Will I ever know the sweet hello  
That's meant for only me

We must both make up our minds,  
Is our angel singing true,  
Is it me is it you ?  
  
I just got to know it now,  
Rode somewhere, some place, somehow  
Is our love as deep as blue  
Is it me is it you ?  
Is it me is it you ?  
  
I'm lost in your love  
Don't think I ever stopped  
I got the feeling that's the reason why

Should we stay or should we bend  
It just gets deeper in the end

So we'll go no more a-roving  
So late into the night,  
Though the heart be still as loving,  
And the moon be still as bright.  
For the sword outwears its sheath,  
And the soul outwears the breast,  
And the heart must pause to breathe,  
And love itself have rest.  
Though the night was made for loving,  
And the day returns too soon,  
Yet we'll go no more a-roving  
By the light of the moon.

Gonna be a victom forever

To turn your life upside down  
  
Take a train to the sea  
Be anyone you want to be  
A little spark of light inside your mind  
Safe and sound off the ground upside down  
  
Wide awake on the edge of the world

Leads me

Hide me

Of laughter

But who can I turn to if you turn away?

"Some say that's where man began  
On this wasted piece of land  
Where evolution's yet to show  
Forbidden Zone  
  
Blasting into outer space  
The planet of the apes  
Evolutions's one hero  
  
Crossing a plain into another dimension  
A million years into the future  
Crossing a path into another dimension  
We the unseen  
  
Back on earth it's all you'll read about  
All the evidence destroyed  
Maps and legends mark the firewalls  
We the lost abandoned saviors  
of the forbidden zone  
  
We shall sustain the forbidden zone

I don't want to leave  
Cos you, were all, there was to know  
About me  
  
Somewhere  
On this crazy island  
A familiar stranger  
Sleeps so far away  
Wonder in the eyes of children  
And the smile of fortune  
Helps the memory fade

"At night  
On some dark quiet street  
Baby, that's where we meet  
When day is through  
They say  
That our love isn't right  
So I wait for each night to be with you  
Till they realize  
Our love's not some passing phase  
We'll just meet at night and pray there  
For better days  
I wait for the darkness to come  
Till we can walk in the sun,  
We'll meet at night  
I wait  
For the darkness to come  
Till we can walk in the sun,  
We'll meet at night, at night...  
At night, come on, come on, now love

Only fools rush in  
But I can't help  
Falling in love with you  
Shall I stay  
Would it be a sin  
If I can't help falling in love with you  
Like a river flows  
Surely to the sea  
Darling so it goes  
Some things are meant to be  
Take my hand,  
Take my whole life too  
For I can't help falling in love with you  
Like a river flows  
Surely to the sea  
Darling so it goes  
Some things are meant to be

Take my whole life too

Comin' apart, breakin' in pieces, baby  
Since you're not around  
You've won, I'm lost  
Nowhere to run to

Oh sweet, sweet baby  
Oh don't turn me away

So, baby, don't cry

Oh, how it hurts  
To see others enjoy love  
I've never known  
And I'm afraid  
That I'll spend all my night  
In my room all alone  
  
Maybe someday I will find someone  
That I can call mine  
On that day my life'll begin  
And I won't be

Are you ready for the country because it's time to go?

Then I ran into the hangman, he said it's time to die

Fly by on the lake.  
Ice frozen six feet deep,  
How long does it take?  
  
I look out on peaceful lands  
With no war nearby,  
An ocean of shakin' hands  
That grab at the sky.

Alone in this empty room  
Too wasted to write my own.

And I would wander around  
Hating the sound of rain  
  
With you beside me  
No wind in winter would blow  
With you beside me  
A rose would bloom in the snow  
  
I gave you my love  
But I was living a dream  
And living would seem in vain  
If I lost you

"A lifeline in a drop of blood  
A dying wish to shun a God  
Sought a dream inside the light  
Finally relieved from plight  
  
O this night is deceiving  
One eternal Winter  
Earth below and reeling  
Moon is riding high  
  
Father and a liar  
One forgotten season  
Secrets in the mire  
Moor is riding high  
  
Aligning  
  
A name inside a memory  
Waiting for you  
When words can't win her  
There is nothing to do  
  
Save your children  
Drenched in poverty  
Tracks in the snow  
Leading them to woe

",Opeth
"Found a way to rid myself clean of pain  
And the fever that's been haunting me  
Has gone away  
  
Looking through my window  
I seem to recognize  
All the people passing by  
But I am alone  
And far from home  
And nobody knows me  
  
Never heard me say goodbye  
Never shall I speak to anyone again  
All days are in darkness  
And I'm biding my time  
Once I am sure of my task I will rise again

",Opeth
"There's a sense of longing in me  
As I read Rosemary's letter  
Her writing's honest  
Can't forget the years she's lost  
  
In isolation  
She talks about her love  
And as I read  
""I'll die alone""  
I know she was aching  
  
There's a certain detail seen here  
The pen must have slipped to the side  
And left a stain  
Next to his name  
She knew he was gone  
  
And isolation  
Is all that would remain  
""The wound in me is pouring out  
To rest on a lover's shore""

",Opeth
"Follow the embers into cities of dreams  
What you'll be seeing is not all what it seems  
Dawn of the liar  
Future's a pyre  
  
Outside the window I see people passing by  
If they could see me now they'd break down and cry  
  
Look down your senses  
Await the gritting beyond  
And in the morning...  
  
Born as a failure  
And died as a stranger  
  
When your country's bleeding while you're forced to mourn  
  
Outside the window I see people passing by  
If they could see me now they'd break down and cry  
  
""Bring me back again""

",Opeth
"Unchain the colours before my eyes,  
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.  
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,  
I shall return from out of fire.  
  
Tears for remembrance, and tears for joy,  
Tears for somebody and this lonely boy.  
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye,  
Flickers above us, to light up the sky.  
  
Unchain the colours before my eyes,  
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.  
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,  
I shall return from out of fire.

",Opeth
"Summer's gone and love has withered  
I believe in nothing yet nothing is what it seems  
All is gone and promises slithered  
You have me nothing yet nothing is what it seems  
  
Summer is gone  
  
Your eyes gave away all your lies in the end  
The dawning of a seething design  
Kept a secret from the light  
And felt the weight on my shoulders increase  
  
A bleeding heart led my desperation  
Like a bird on a wire  
A broken promise of dedication  
Never ever again

",Opeth
"When summer's gone and winter's past  
It seems like a neverending way  
And thinking of what I have to say  
It seems like a neverending way  
I am within you now, with my sinful cry  
I am within you, now one am I  
Perish the love, perish your love  
When the sunfilled summer comes to love  
It seems like a neverending way  
It comes to us like a snow-white dove  
It seems like a neverending way  
I am within you now with my lonely cry  
I am within you now 'till the time we die  
I am within you now 'till the time we perish the love  
Perish your love

"Saracen blood spilled as crosses are rising high  
Men giving their lives, for the Holy See they die  
Walls surround this golden city like a crown of thorns  
Will the wailing ever cease, will we forever mourn?

The city once apart that now is one

"You! Yes, you! Stand still laddy  
  
When we grew up and went to school  
There were certain teachers who would  
Hurt the children any way they could  
By pouring their derision  
Upon anything we did  
Exposing every weakness  
However carefully hidden by the kids  
But in the town it was well known  
When they got home at night, their fat and  
Psychopathic wives would thrash them  
Within inches of their lives

"Lucifer Sam, Siam cat.  
Always sitting by your side  
Always by your side.  
That cat's something I can't explain.  
  
Ginger the gentle you're the witch.  
You're the left side  
He's the right side.  
Oh, no!  
That cat's something I can't explain.  
  
Lucifer go to sea.  
Be a hip cat, be a ship's cat.  
Somewhere, anywhere.  
That cat's something I can't explain.  
  
At night prowling sifting sand.  
Hiding around on the ground.  
He'll be found when you're around.  
That cat's something I can't explain.

"Remember a day before today  
A day when you were young.  
Free to play alone with time  
Evening never came.  
Sing a song that can't be sung  
Without the morning's kiss  
Queen, you shall be it if you wish  
Look for your king  
Why can't we play today  
Why can't we stay that way  
  
Climb your favorite apple tree  
Try to catch the sun  
Hide from your little brother's gun  
Dream yourself away  
Why can't we reach the sun  
Why can't we blow the years away  
Blow away

"I was standing by the Nile  
When I saw the lady smile  
I would take her out for a while  
For a while  
  
Oh, my tears wept like a child  
How her golden hair was blowing wild  
Then she spread her wings to fly  
For to fly  
  
Soaring high above the breezes  
Going always where she pleases  
She will make it to the islands in the sun  
  
I will follow in her shadow  
As I watch her from my window  
One day I will catch her eye  
  
She is calling from the deep  
Summoning my soul to endless sleep  
She is bound to drag me down  
Drag me down

And daddy loves you too.  
And the sea may look warm to you babe  
And the sky may look blue  
Ooooh baby  
Ooooh baby blue  
Oooooh babe.  
  
If you should go skating  
On the thin ice of modern life  
Dragging behind you the silent reproach  
Of a million tear-stained eyes  
Don't be surprised when a crack in the ice  
Appears under your feet.  
You slip out of your depth and out of your mind  
With your fear flowing out behind you  
As you claw the thin ice.

"When I think of the way that He gave all for me  
I just can't stop singing this song that I sing  
He is so unbelievable take it from me  
His Love is irreplaceable it's all that I need  
For everything that He's done in me  
All I wanna do is just Praise Him  
(Everybody)  
I don't know what you've come to do  
I've come to Praise Him, Praise Him, Praise Him  
It's just plain to see that when I'm Praising Him  
I can't contain it, I can't hold it in

And I kissed it clean,

Are the songs my disease?  
Are the songs my disease?  
Maybe she's creating me,  
Mistaken accidentally,  
For a girl I used to know,  
In darkness permanently,  
If I find her the perfect line,  
My sickness might desert me.

And don't be afraid of the dark  
At the end of the storm  
Is a golden sky,  
And the sweet silver song of a lark.  
  
[Chorus]  
Walk on through the wind  
Walk on through the rain  
  
Though your dreams be tossed and blown, ooh, ooh  
Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart  
And you'll never walk alone  
You'll never walk alone, ooh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You never walk a-lone.

"Away in a manger, no crib for a bed  
The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head  
The stars in the sky looked down where He lay  
The little Lord Jesus, asleep on the hay.  
  
The cattle are lowing, the Baby awakes  
But little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes  
I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky  
And stay by my cradle til morning is nigh.  
  
Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay  
Close by me forever, and love me, I pray  
Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care  
And fit us for heaven to live with Thee there...

"Breathe on me, breath of God,  
Fill me with life anew,  
That I may love what Thou dost love,  
And do what Thou wouldst do.  
  
Breathe on me, breath of God,  
Until my heart is pure,  
Until with Thee I will one will,  
To do and to endure.  
  
Breathe on me, breath of God,  
Blend all my soul with Thine,  
Until this earthly part of me  
Glows with Thy fire divine.  
  
Breathe on me, breath of God,  
So shall I never die,  
But live with Thee the perfect life  
Of Thine eternity.

Over the hills and everywhere  
Go, tell it on the mountain

Over silent flocks by night  
Behold throughout the heavens  
There shone a holy light.

When lo! Above the earth

Walk upon England's mountain green?  
And was the holy Lamb of God  
On England's pleasant pastures seen?  
And did the countenance divine  
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?  
And was Jerusalem builded here  
Among those dark satanic mills?  
  
Bring me my bow of burning gold!  
Bring me my arrows of desire!  
Bring me my spear! O clouds, unfold!  
Bring me my chariot of fire!

Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand,  
Till we have built Jerusalem  
In England's green and pleasant land.

Wide eyed and hopefully wild.  
  
We barely remember what came before this precious moment,  
Choosing to be here right now. Hold on, stay inside  
This body holding me, reminding me that I am not alone in  
This body makes me feel eternal. All this pain is an illusion.

"Not tonight josephine.  
In an army's strength therein  
Lies the denouement. From  
Here you're haunting me. By  
The Seine so beautiful, only  
Not to be of use, impossible.  
So strange, victory, 1200 spires  
The only sound, moscow burning.  
Empty like the Tuileries. Like a dream  
Vienna seems, only not to be of use- impossible.  
In the last extremity, to  
Advance or not to advance, I  
Hear you laughing  
Even still you're calling me  
""not tonight, not tonight  
Not tonight""

"He never felt that she cared  
Turning to leave  
Feeling her lonely stare  
If only a secret love  
  
Left more than a broken heart  
Like a fool thanks he felt the start  
Of what he hoped for so long  
  
He waits though he knows she's gone  
Alone he climbs  
Until he falls  
  
Only a secret love brings more than a broken heart  
  
Like a fool I have played the part  
Of what I hoped for so long  
The need to belong  
In love

But when I saw your eyes,  
I knew for the first time,  
That there's no goodbye between us.  
  
There's no goodbye,  
There's no goodbye,  
There's no goodbye between us.  
  
If one day we slip away,  
And that may be in the cards,  
We will know deep in our hearts  
That there's no goodbye between us.  
  
There's no goodbye,  
There's no goodbye,  
There's no goodbye between us.  
  
There's no goodbye,  
There's no goodbye,  
There's no goodbye between us.

"I turned a corner  
It didn't seem that was wrong  
I was just having a laugh  
But suddenly my friends are gone  
And I didn't know that life would be so long  
  
I turned the clock  
And went around the block  
Thought I was just having a laugh  
But suddenly my world was gone  
And I found myself standing alone  
  
I thought I was fighting the ebb of life  
I thought I was cutting the web and the strife  
But I look at the mirror where there used to be a smile  
Now I see a stranger

So could have my name  
Have you done what I've asked of you?  
I asked you to come unto me  
Give all your cares and burdens to me  
For I truly love you  
Somehow I can't get through

There'll be no regretting.  
Will she remember me,  
Will she forget?  
I'll send a thousand flow'rs  
When the trade winds blow.  
I'll send my lonely heart,  
For i love her so.  
Someday i know  
She'll come back again to me.  
Till then my heart will be  
Beyond the reef  
  
Some day i know  
She'll come back again to me  
Till then my heart will be  
Beyond the reef

"Night and you and blue hawaii  
The night is heavenly and you are heaven to me  
Lovely you and blue hawaii  
With all this loveliness there should be love  
Come with me while the moon is on the sea  
The night is young and so are we, so are we  
Dreams come true in blue hawaii  
And mine could all come true this magic night of nights with you  
Come with me while the moon is on the sea (the moon is on the sea)

"I found my thrill on blueberry hill  
On blueberry hill where i found you  
The moon stood still on blueberry hill  
And lingered till my dreams came true  
  
The wind in the willow played  
Love's sweet melody  
But all of those vows we made  
Were never to be  
  
Tho' we're apart you're part of me still  
For you were my thrill on blueberry hill

"Can I forget you?  
Or will my heart remind me,  
That once we walked in a moonlight dream?  
  
Can I forget you,  
Or will my heart remind me,  
How sweet you made the moonlight seem.  
  
Will the glory of your nearness fade,  
As moonlight fades in a veil of rain?  
  
Can I forget you,  
When every night reminds me,  
How much I want you back again.  
  
Can I forget you,  
When every night reminds me,  
How much I want you back again.

"Once I was alone  
So lonely and then  
You came, out of nowhere  
Like the sun up from the hills  
  
Cold, cold was the wind  
Warm, warm were your lips  
Out there, on that ski trail  
Where your kiss filled me with thrills  
  
A weekend in Canada, a change of scene  
Was the most I bargained for  
And then I discovered you and in your eyes  
I found the love that I couldn't ignore  
  
Down, down came the sun  
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart  
I knew when the sun set  
From that day, we'd never ever part

But I cant help falling in love with you.  
Shall I stay, would it be a sin?  
If I cant help falling in love with you.

Darling so it goes,  
Some things are meant to be.  
  
Take my hand, take my whole life too.  
For I cant help falling in love with you.

"When we played our charade  
We were like children posing  
Playing at games, acting out names  
Guessing the parts we played  
  
Oh what a hit we made  
We came on next to closing  
Best on the bill, lovers until  
Love left the masquerade  
  
Fate seemed to pull the strings  
I turned and you were gone  
While from the darkened wings  
The music box played on  
  
Sad little serenade  
Song of my heart's composing  
I hear it still, I always will  
Best on the bill

Children's eyes are wide to see  
Santa's presents 'neath the tree  
All day asked for on his knee  
  
Christmas present, Christmas past  
From the presents which one's last  
Christmas future sure to be  
Looking underneath the tree  
  
For the present, look high, not low

Christmas presents at the start  
Was a gift from someone's heart

Writing love letters in the sand

Each time i saw the tide  
Take our love letters from the sand  
  
You made a vow that you would ever be true  
But somehow that vow meant nothing to you

Over love letters in the sand

That tempts the sould to the ocean cold  
To with the body lay

Does it stain your lips?  
What is the fruit-like?  
Just beyond my finger tips?  
Just out of reach, I see so much  
I cannot taste and mustn't touch  
Tied to my little world  
My safe little world  
What would it be like  
If I broke the string?  
Would it be lovely  
And a little frightening?  
There is so much I've never understood  
How does the wine taste? Is it good?

Does it make you glow?

I know beyond a doubt  
My heart will lead me there soon  
  
We'll meet beyond the shore  
We'll kiss just as before  
Happy we'll be beyond the sea  
And never again i'll go sailing  
Some sailing

"There's something that rules our destiny  
Right from the first day of our birth  
although you may not care for me  
You have your mission on this earth  
You were born to love  
Sure as you live  
Born with everything heaven could give  
You have eyes and they express  
Love at a glance  
You have lips who's tenderness  
Speak of romance  
Like a dream of love, lovely to see  
You're the angel of my destiny  
And to think that you have found  
Your place on earth only to be  
Born to love and be loved by me

",Billie Holiday
"Love is funny or it's sad  
Or it's quit or it's mad  
It's a good thing or it's bad  
  
But beautiful  
Beautiful to take a chance and if you fall, you fall  
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all  
Love is tearful or it's gay  
It's a problem or it's a play  
It's heartache either way  
  
But beautiful  
And I'm thinking if you were mine  
I'd never let you go  
And that would be  
But beautiful  
I know  
Love is beautiful  
I know

"Day in, day out  
That same old voodoo follows me about  
That same old pounding in my heart, whenever I think of you  
And baby I think of you  
Day in and day out  
  
Day out, day in  
I needn't tell you how my days begin  
When I awake I get up with a tingle  
One possibility in view  
That possibility of maybe seeing you  
  
Come rain, come shine  
I meet you and to me the day is fine  
Then I kiss your lips, and the pounding becomes  
An oceans roar, a thousand drums  
Can't you see it's love, can there be any doubt  
When there it is, day in, day out

",Billie Holiday
"Do you know what is means to miss New Orleans  
I miss it, each night and day  
The longer I stay away  
Miss the moist covered vines  
The tall sugar pines  
Where mocking birds use to sing  
And I like to see the lazy Mississippi  
Are hurrying to spring  
The mardy grass memories  
Of creol tunes that fill the air  
I dream of Orleanders in June  
And soon I'm wishing that I was there  
Do you know what is means to miss New Orleans  
And there is something more  
I miss the one I care for  
More than I miss New Orleans

"Hush now, don't explain  
Just say you'll remain  
I'm glad your back, don't explain  
  
Quiet, don't explain  
What is there to gain  
Skip that lipstick  
Don't explain  
  
You know that I love you  
And what endures  
All my thoughts of you  
For I'm so completely yours  
  
Cry to hear folks chatter  
And I know you cheat  
Right or wrong, don't matter  
When you're with me, sweet  
  
Hush now, don't explain  
You're my joy and pain  
My life's yours love  
Don't explain.

"Don't worry 'bout me  
I'll get along  
Just you forget about me  
Be happy my love  
  
Just say that our little show is over  
And so the story ends  
Why not call it a day, the sensible way  
And we'll remain friends  
  
Look out for yourself  
Should be the rule  
Just give your heart and your love  
To whom ever you love  
Don't you be a fool  
  
Baby why stop and cling  
To some fading thing  
That used to be  
So if you can't forget  
Don't you worry 'bout me

"Living for you is easy living  
It's easy to live when you're in love  
And I'm so in love  
There is nothing in life but you  
  
I never regret the years I'm giving  
They're easy to give when you're in love  
I'm happy to do whatever I do for you  
  
For you maybe I'm a fool  
But it's fun  
People say you rule me with one wave of your hand  
Darling, it's grand  
They just don't understand  
  
Living for you is easy living  
It's easy to live when you're in love  
And I'm so in love  
There's nothing in life but you

"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time  
In thinking such a thing could be  
That you could ever care for me  
  
I'm sure you hate to hear  
That I adore you, dear  
But grant me  
Just the same  
  
I'm not entirely to blame  
For love  
You'd be so easy to love  
So easy to idolize  
All others above  
  
So worth the yearning for  
So swell to keep every home fire burning for  
We'd be so grand at the game  
So carefree together  
That it does seem a shame  
That you can't see  
Your future with me  
'Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love

"Ghost of yesterday  
Stalking 'round my room  
All night long you stay  
Walk around profound gloom  
When the darkness falls  
When I've gone to bed  
Weirdly come your calls  
Mournfully, scornfully dead  
  
Folly of a love I strangled  
Pulsing heart I thought was gone  
Gives no peace  
Will not cease  
Prowling 'round till dawn  
Ghost of yesterday  
Every night you're here  
Whispering away  
""Might have been, might have been, oh, my dear""  
Foolish heart must pay  
Ghost of yesterday  
Yesterday

"I'll forget your tender kiss  
I'll be brave after this kiss  
I'll say ""Hello my darling""  
It we should meet again  
  
You'll forbid the tears to slip  
You'll behave, bite your lip  
And say ""Hello my darling""  
If we should meet again  
  
If we do meet again  
Our moments can't be sweet again  
Oh my love, go my love  
Though it's a bitter pill, I know my love  
  
Please remember not to sigh  
Over this last goodbye  
Just say ""Hello my darling""  
If we should meet again

"See the house lights start to blink  
And the sky is turnin' pink  
Gosh what will the neighbors think  
Cause here it is tomorrow again  
  
We could share a perfect day  
But we've danced the night away  
Guess you'd better hit the hay  
Cause here it is tomorrow again  
  
We saw the sunset in the sky  
Soon we'll see the dawn  
Mother Nature's about to rise  
And Father Time is marchin' on  
  
Did you hear my daddy yell?  
We've been leaning on the bell  
Kiss me quick and run like sixty  
Because here it is tomorrow again

"Irving berlin  
How can I tell you what is in my heart?  
How can I measure each and every part?  
How can I tell you how much I love you?  
How can I measure just how much I do?  
How much do I love you?  
I'll tell you no lie  
How deep is the ocean?  
How high is the sky?  
How many times a day do I think of you?  
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?  
How far would I travel  
To be where you are?  
How far is the journey  
From here to a star?  
And if I ever lost you  
How much would I cry?  
How deep is the ocean?  
How high is the sky?

"I hear music  
Mighty fine music  
The murmur of a morning breeze up there  
The rattle of the milkman on the stair  
  
Sure that's music  
Mighty fine music  
The singing of a sparrow in the sky  
The perking of the coffee right near by  
That's my favorite melody  
You my angel, phoning me  
I hear music  
Mighty fine music  
And anytime I think my world is wrong  
I get me out of bed and sing this song

"My love must be a kind of blind love,  
I can't see anyone but you  
And dear, I wonder if you find love,  
An optical illusion, too?  
Are the stars out tonight?  
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright cause I only  
Have eyes for you.  
  
The moon may be high,  
But I can't see a thing in the sky,  
Cause I only have eyes for you.  
I don't know if we're in a garden,  
Or on a crowded avenue.  
You are here, so am I.  
Maybe millions of people go by but they all disappear from view,  
And I only have eyes for you.

",Billie Holiday
"I took a trip on a train  
And I thought about you  
I passed a shadowy lane  
And I thought about you  
  
Two or three cars parked under the stars  
A winding stream  
Moon shining down on some little town  
And with each beam, the same old dream  
  
And every stop that we made, oh, I thought about you  
When I pulled down the shade then I really felt blue  
I peeked through the crack, looked at the track  
The one going back to you  
And what did I do? I thought about you

"Joys that come to others  
Seldom come to me  
But if I only were Aladdin  
How different things would be  
Every time I wish  
I wish I had you  
Every time I dream  
The dream is for two  
You're the part within my heart  
That beats all day  
Seems to say, ""I love you""  
  
Everywhere I go  
You're all that I see  
Wonder if you know  
What you mean to me  
Wishes would be grand  
If only they came true  
For every time I wish  
I wish I had you

It I were you

I'd string along with me  
Instead of keepin' me on a string  
  
I'd love me the whole day long  
You'd never catch me nappin'  
Wouldn't have a change of heart  
Not for fear  
That such a thing should happen

I'd stick to me  
My whole life through

Light up my lover's way  
And every star above you  
Would obey, say  
If you were mine  
  
I would live for your love alone  
To kneel at your shrine  
I would give up all that I own  
Yes even my heart  
Even my life  
  
I'd trade it all for you  
And think I was lucky too  
If you were mine

I'll never love again  
I'm so in love with you  
I'll never thrill again

The sunshine I'm needing  
Ain't that a shame

With troubles that creep up  
From out of nowhere  
When love's to blame

No good

I'm a fool to want you  
To want a love that can't be true  
A love that's there for others too  
  
I'm a fool to hold you  
Such a fool to hold you  
To seek a kiss not mine alone  
To share a kiss that Devil has known  
  
Time and time again I said I'd leave you  
Time and time again I went away  
But then would come the time when I would need you  
And once again these words I had to say  
  
Take me back, I love you  
I need you

And the stars forfeit of broken heart  
No matter it they do  
You'll find that I'm all for you  
  
I only know come what may  
You'll always find me by your side  
I may be a fool  
Time alone will decide

I play with the crowd  
But oh, if they only knew  
I'm painting the town red  
To hide a heart that's blue  
Must I go on carrin' on?  
  
My merry song is just pretend  
Loving you so, wanting you so  
Where will it end, how will it end?

Are right in time to hide my heartache  
Let them ask me why I'm sad

It scares me  
I wonder if I will pass  
And springtime, I hear  
Is early this year

Who is as divine as you are  
  
It's like flying without wings  
Playing fiddle without strings  
And a million other things  
No one can do  
Though my hopes are slender  
In my secret heart I pray you'll surrender soon  
No, it's like reaching for the moon

As far as I can see this is heaven  
And speaking just for me  
It's ours to share  
Perhaps the glow of love will grow  
With every passing day  
Or we may never meet again

Two hearts away deep in a dream  
  
The same old story  
It's been told much too much before  
The same old story

It's all fun and laughter  
They lived ever after in ecstasy  
The same old story but it's new to me

Can't ignore this temperature  
But if you want to make love, okay  
  
Let's find a cozy nook  
Beside a babbling brook  
Let's find a shady tree  
Let the love birds talk for you and me

When any old corner becomes a corner  
Of heaven, blue heaven  
  
I'm gonna dance with a dream  
We'll dance on air  
I'm gonna speak to a dream

Off with my overcoat  
Off with my glove

Upon my lips I feel  
A tender kiss, you're almost real

I'm trying to spend my life without you  
I turn, I run, I hide, but I know deep inside  
A part of me has died, yeah, yeah

That blissful all enthralling day

From dusk 'til dawn

This land is where I make my stand.  
No other heart is truer then,

"Love, look at the two of us  
Strangers in many ways  
We've got a lifetime to share  
So much to say  
And as we go  
From day to day  
I'll feel you close to me  
But time alone will tell  
Let's take a lifetime to say,  
""i knew you well""  
For only time will tell us so  
And love may grow  
For all we know

If I don't have you never be the same  
I don't love you, but girl you'd drive a man  
Insane  
I don't love you

I don't even want to know your name

You'd better start singin' the blues.

You come upon my mind and take it away  
Just like at the time  
The things we did made our hearts skip away  
Down on my knees I prayed  
Kind woman don't go astray  
When it seems at times  
I've got my mind and heart all straight away  
Just when you've become  
A memory of the past and fade away  
I see your face and think of all  
Of all that we had  
With of the things that you brought me  
Now was it so bad  
Makes me wonder  
Just like yesterday  
You come upon my mind and take it away.

Had waited my whole life through  
And as I held you tight  
They shined even brighter

Sing out loud  
Sing out strong

Sing of happy not sad.

Where little children laughed as they sang  
A happy song  
In the little town of Ceylon,  
Ceylon city, Ceylon city  
  
I've got a boat , i hope it's still afloat  
With rusty sails, and an old wooden oar  
It goes along, in the little town of Ceylon  
  
Ceylon city  
My daddy will be waiting there  
My sister will be combing down her silver hair  
My mama will be waiting there  
Serving lunch to my brother, but he's nowhere

While the lazy town was sleeping  
Strangest love that I ever knew  
Feel the wind blow, see the shadows  
Kiss the breeze of a sudden shore  
Of my life's loves and fascinations

With the neck of a bottle, and the groove of the tracks

In the clearing

He pledged himself to her

We'll bring the rounds and some jazzy sound  
To play by a cozy fire  
You two roast wieners and we'll toast the buns  
And we'll chow till the night grows nighter  
  
We'll call for you on the weekend  
We two, you two, no more  
And ride out somewhere in the country air  
Just a cozy clan of four

Without a dream in my heart,  
Without a love of my own,

You heard me saying a prayer for,  
Someone I really could care for,

The only one my arms will ever hold,  
I heard somebody whisper ""please adore me,""

Thronged the air  
But only his mother  
In her maiden bliss  
Worshiped the beloved  
With a kiss  
  
What can I give him  
Poor as I am  
If I were a sheperd  
I would give a lamb  
If I were a wise man  
I would do my part  
But what I can I give him  
Give him my heart

"Just the other day-  
I heard you walked out on her  
Just the other day-  
I heard it's not forever  
You say, anyway-  
You said it's not like before  
Just the other day-  
Did she let you go  
Did she let you go.  
Just the other day-  
You lost the girl you adored  
Just the other day-  
You boyish love was the cause  
Did she cost you pain  
You could have held out for more  
Just the other day-  
Did she let you go  
Did she let you go  
I see your walking alone  
Will you still talk to me  
If she's not by your side anymore.

"Hold me close and hold me fast  
The magic spell you cast  
This is la vie en rose  
  
When you kiss me heaven sighs  
And though I close my eyes  
I see La vie en rose  
  
When you press me to your heart  
I'm in a world apart  
A world where roses bloom  
And when you speak, angels sing from above  
Everyday words seem to turn into love songs  
Give your heart and soul to me  
And life will always be La vie en rose

"Long ago a lonely man stood  
Off of a quiet avenue  
A pretty girl in passing chanced to look  
That's when he fell, fell for you  
I listen to the rain  
Pounding on the railing  
The beat's a sweet, soft refrain  
Of how he found you LORRAINE  
He's rocking on a porch you used to know  
Here where he swore his love was true  
He sips his drink and dreams the days of old  
Of when he fell, fell for you  
I listen to the rain...

I'm not so sure  
Maybe he'll know  
Maybe he'll be my cure  
Ah, ah, ah.  
  
Maybe he'll know  
I'm not so sure  
Maybe he'll know  
Maybe he'll be - oh  
  
Something calls to me  
I know, I know  
I hear an echo start to pound like a drum, I'm  
Chanting a song, anchor me-  
But don't take too long...no, no, no, no  
  
I got an anxious feeling  
Got this ache engraved in me like stone-  
Don't take too long  
Say you'll never leave me say you'll never go.

"Rockin' around the Christmas tree  
At the Christmas party hop  
Mistletoe hung where you can see  
Every couple tries to stop  
  
Rockin' around the Christmas tree  
Let the Christmas spirit ring  
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie  
And we'll do some caroling  
  
You will get a sentimental feeling  
When you hear  
Voices singing ""Let's be jolly  
Deck the halls with boughs of holly""

Everyone dancing merrily  
In the new old fashioned way

"I have carried all my hopes and dreams  
To this new land with my own two hands  
I have followed the sun away from ireland,  
Now like the red man, here I stand.  
  
You hear whispers of the homeland call,  
Love is less kind than the twilight.  
And the passion for me once in your green eyes,  
Like the sunlight fades from sight.  
  
Twilight eyes, I can taste the salty tears of goodbye.  
I can feel the cold north sea,  
You'll be sailing with the tide  
To the island in your emerald twilight eyes.

When I see the sign that points ""one way"".  
The lot we used to pass by every day.  
  
Just walk away renee,  
You won't see me follow you back home.  
And as the rain beats down,  
Upon my weary eyes.  
For me it cries.  
  
Your name and mine inside a heart, upon the wall,  
Still find a way to haunt me,  
Though they're so small.  
  
Just walk away renee,  
You won't see me follow you back home.  
These empty sidewalks on my block  
Are not the same.  
You're not to blame.

You make me happy with the things you do  
Oh, can it be so  
This feeling follows me wherever I go  
I never did believe in miracles  
But I've a feeling it's time to try  
I never did believe in the ways of magic  
But I'm beginning to wonder why  
Don't, don't break the spell,  
It would be different and you know it will  
You, you make loving fun  
I don't have to tell you you're the only one  
You make loving fun  
It's all I wanna do

"Be on you way  
Don't try to say that  
You love me still.  
If we couldn't find  
The right dream by now  
Then we never will.  
We paid our dues at the door  
And never once saw the stage.  
We wrote our share of love's lore  
And never quite filled the page.  
So be on your way.  
  
Be on your way.  
Maybe someday we will  
Meet again.  
Try not to cry  
Tears make me think  
How it might have been.  
We loved as strong as we could  
But love only got in our way.  
We took our time to be free  
There's nothing much more to say but  
Be on your way.

Dear one, your kiss is rich as wine  
And it's mine, yes it's mine the wonder of you  
Yours, love is yours, because I love you  
To you I give my heart so madly madly beating  
With every beat repeating I'll always love you so  
And it's mine, yes it's mine the wonder of you  
Yours, love is yours, because I love you  
To you I give my heart so madly madly beating  
With every beat repeating I'll always love you so

That this heart of mine embraces all day through  
In that small cafe, the park across the way  
The children's carousel,  
The chestnut trees, the wishing well  
  
I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day  
In everything that's light and gay  
I'll always think of you that way

And when the night is new  
I'll be looking at the moon

But your lips deny they're true  
Will your answer really change things  
Making me blue?  
I'm afraid some day you'll leave me  
Saying, ""Can't we still be friends?""

Escapes us to enforce a word, no  
Holding on to pain it may seem to some  
  
The easy way to say o.k., twist your  
Knife a little deeper  
Words to sharp actions dark  
Hide the blade of the deceiver.  
  
Enforce the words no more, be free  
Alone you might just find serenity.  
  
To accept another day we choose  
To give away another piece of life  
To forgive is to suffer  
  
Once or twice is kind  
Three or four is blind  
It is not the end yet a way to begin  
The power of words both good and bad.

I tied a rope around her waist

She goes out  
Well there ain't nothing to guess about  
She covers her ears when i play my guitar  
She runs away but not very far  
Just push a button - retractable cord  
I pull her back when i get bored  
One word from her and she'd be free  
But she's exactly where she wants to be  
Magnetic Madonna she glows in the night  
Reciprocal pull, i flow to her light

Buat dia selalu memikirkan diriku

Tancapkanlah cepat tepat dijantung hatinya

"This is the sweetest place  
Baring my feeling  
I'm welcoming an eye  
Into the darkest one  
It tells me not to worry  
For the time is yet to come  
For someone to arrive  
And heal the troubled one  
Suddenly the rainfalls  
Showering a desert stone  
Wash away these tears of yesterday  
I hear the sound of  
A raising chorus  
Sung by the angels  
And the broken heroes  
I wont go back now I feel so right  
I've found a place  
Where dreams and life become one  
And finally I don' t have to run  
I've found a place  
Where dreams and life become one

I hope that he turns out to be  
Someone who'll watch over me  
  
I'm a little lamb who's lost in a wood  
I know I could always be good  
To one who'll watch over me  
  
Although he may not be the man some girls think of  
As handsome to my heart  
He carries the key  
  
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed  
Follow my lead, oh how I need  
Someone who'll watch over me

"The moon retreats behind a silver cloud  
As darkness throws its cloak towards the earth  
And mystery replaces what thought we knew  
  
To turn the stone, to turn the stone  
The one dimension only shows one side  
But do we see the same through different eyes  
As you and I peer into life's kaleidoscope  
  
To turn the stone, to turn the stone  
Eternal sands of time shift endlessly  
Behind a veil of motionless disguise  
An eyelid flash is all it really seems to need  
  
To turn the stone, to turn the stone  
To turn the stone, to turn the stone

Gonna stop my cryin' , leave you alone  
If you don't think I'm leavin'  
You just count the days I'm gone  
'Cause you' re gonna need me  
Need your lovin' daddy one of these days  
Yeah, and you gonna be oh-so-sorry you treated me this way

"Put your little hands in mine  
Say you'll love me all the time  
My heart is sighing, it's almost dying  
My eyes are crying for you  
Hold me close and squeeze me tight  
If you would only treat me right  
My heart is sighing, it's almost dying  
My eyes are crying for you  
I loved you since time began  
And I always will  
I need you here by my side  
This world's to know how I feel  
Let me whisper in your ear  
Little words like ""I love you dear""  
My heart is sighing, it's almost dying  
My eyes are crying for you

"See them laugh  
Watch them stare (watch them stare)  
They always do when I'm with you  
See, they say our love will never hold  
That you're too young and I'm too old  
And just the same. I don't feel blue  
'Cause I have you (I-I-I have you)  
See them laugh  
Why won't they (why won't they)  
Give us a chance for our romance  
See, although our age is not the same  
I love you so, I can't explain  
'Cause it don't matter what they say or do  
(I-I-I do) See

"Slowly but surely, though I love you dearly  
Slowly but surely I'm losin' you  
Soon you'll be leavin', soon I'll be grievin'  
Slowly but surely I'm losin' you  
I can see it in your eyes, I can feel it in your kiss  
But I didn't realise it would all end like this  
Slowly but surely, though I love you dearly  
Slowly but surely. I'm losin' you  
  
Somebody's takin' my place, I can plainly see  
It's written on your face, you're not satisfied with me  
Slowly but surely, though I love you dearly  
Slowly but surely, I'm losin' you

"They're really rockin' on bandstands, Philadelphia, P. A.  
Deep in the heart of Texas, way down to Frisco bay  
All over St. Louis, way down to New orleans  
All the cats wanna dance with sweet little sixteen  
Sweet little sixteen, got the growin' up blues  
Tight dresses and lipstick, sportin' high heel shoes  
Oh, but tomorrow morning, she'll have to change her trend  
Go back to bein' just sixteen and back in class again

"To spend one night with you in our old rendez-vous  
And reminis with you, that's my desire  
To hear you whisper low, just when it's time to go  
Oh, cherry 1 love you so, that's my desire  
We'll sip a little glass of wine  
I'll gaze into your eyes devine  
And feel the touch of your lips pressing on mine  
To meet where gipsies play, down in some dim cafe  
And dance till break of day, that's my desire

"Think of me and miss me, as I'll be missing you  
Promise to be true and I'll be true to you  
Dream of me and talk to me, though we're far apart  
I will hear you dear, hear you in my heart  
When you're all alone and you're feelin' blue  
Remember that I'm here and I'll be lonely too  
And the sun will shine and our love will grow  
Oh, time cannot erase a love like ours, I know  
So, think of me and miss me, as I'll be missing you  
Promise to be true and I'll be true to you

"Now there are three steps to heaven  
Just listen and you will plainly see  
And as life travels on and things do go wrong  
Just follow steps one, two and three  
Step one, you find a girl you love  
Step two, she falls in love with you  
Step three, you kiss and hold her tightly  
Yeah that sure seems like heaven to me  
The formula for heaven's very simply  
Just follow the rules and you will see  
And as life travels on and things do go wrong  
Just follow steps one, two and three

"The day outside is warm, the sun is shinin' bright  
But since you're gone, the time is wrong  
It's a twenty-four hour night  
My heart is filled with bloom, my soul has lost it's light  
I sit here in my lonely room, it's a twenty-four hour night  
My life is an endless torture, cold and bare and black  
You know how much I want you  
Please, please, please come back  
Come back and take my heart, come make this darkness bright  
Come back again and please, please end  
These twenty-four hour nights, twenty-four hour nights

You keep movin' cross my mind  
You gave me a sunny day  
Now it looks as if I'll pay

Why do they say, bluebird is dead  
I can still see her, touch her, my bluebird  
The love that she gave, I don't believe, no, no, I don't believe  
  
Bluebird came to me tonight  
Waiting patiently for light  
She said I know that you will grieve  
But my darlin' I must leave

Please I cannot hear you speak  
It must be that you're so tired  
In the darkness of the night

"Deep waters flow, out to the sea,  
They never needed you or me.  
One summer dream, one summer dream.  
  
Blue mountains high and valley low,  
I don't know which way I should go,  
One summer dream, one summer dream.  
  
Warm summer breeze blows endlessly,  
Touching the hearts of those who feel,  
One summer dream, one summer dream.  
  
Bird on wing goes floating by,  
But there's a teardrop in his eye,  
One summer dream, one summer dream.  
One summer dream, one summer dream.

Someone calling at my door,  
Too bad,

Wonder what tomorrow brings,  
Who knows,  
I'm getting out of love.

My Shangri-la has gone away,  
Faded like the Beatles on Hey Jude  
She seemed to drift out on the rain  
That came in somewhere softly from the blue

Raindrops fall on everyone,  
So sad,  
I'm getting out of love.

Out there so far away  
Above the sky will say  
For you...  
Here it comes again  
It's all around me  
It must be magic  
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
  
I can see you  
In my mind  
The lost time  
That you're saving  
I could reach out  
And touch you  
What can i do?  
The sun ain't shining.  
  
Out there so far away  
Above the sky will say  
For you...

But they don't understand and no one hears the sound,  
It's like a waterfall, it's an illusion.

Love is all, waterfall, love is what you are,  
Pulls you in, takes you down, it's a sad affair,  
But you know as you hold back the power there without the friends  
And lovers you could never go on living.  
  
Across the waterfall that's falling evermore down on you,  
Cascading through the days, and flowing on it's way,  
That's how it has to be, just an illusion.

It ended a moment ago  
This is the end of a beautiful friendship

'Cause your eyes told me so  
  
We've always been  
Like sister and brother  
Until tonight  
When we looked at each other  
  
That was the end of a beautiful friendship  
And just the beginning of love  
  
That was the end of a beautiful friendship  
And just the beginning of love

Bad times, may bar you from Sak's

Breaks down your self control

So baby, this rule I propose  
Always have an ace in the hole

So natural that you want to go to war--  
That's just the bestest band what am, honey lamb!

"All too soon  
We had to part  
The moment you had touched my heart  
And with you went my dream  
  
All too soon  
All too sweet  
Was our affair  
And you put all the sweetness there  
  
What a shame that it's gone  
All too soon  
I knew the strange delights  
That only you in love could bring  
  
And as I reached the heights  
The bottom fell from everything  
You should know as well as I  
Our love deserves another try  
  
For we whispered goodbye  
All too soon  
Too soon

"We meet and the angels sing  
The angels sing the sweetest song I've ever heard  
You speak and the angels sing  
Or am I reading music into every word?  
  
Suddenly the setting is strange  
I can see water and moonlight beaming  
Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore  
Then suddenly I see it all change  
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming  
Through it all your face that I adore  
  
You smile and the angels sing  
And though it's just a gentle murmur at the start  
We kiss and the angels sing  
And leave their music ringing in my heart

"Oh baby, won't you please come home?  
'Cause your mama's all alone  
I have tried in vain  
Never no more to call your name  
  
When you left, you broke my heart  
Because I never thought we'd part  
Every hour in the day you will hear me say  
Baby, won't you please come home?  
  
When you left, you broke my heart  
Because I never thought we'd part  
Every hour in the day you will hear me say  
Oh baby, my baby

'Cause your mama needs some lovin'  
Baby, won't you please come on home?

"Say, its only a paper moon  
Sailing over a cardboard sea  
But it wouldn't be make-believe  
If you believed in me  
  
Yes, it's only a canvas sky  
Hanging over a muslin tree  
But it wouldn't be make-believe  
If you believed in me  
  
Without your love  
It's a honky-tonk parade  
Without your love  
It's a melody played in a penny arcade  
  
It's a Barnum and Bailey world  
Just as phony as it can be  
But it wouldn't be make-believe  
If you believed in me

"Night and stars above that shine so bright  
The mystery of their fading light  
That shines upon our caravan  
  
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep  
Across the sand so I may keep  
The memory of our caravan  
  
This is so exciting  
You are so inviting  
Resting in my arms  
As I thrill to the magic charms  
  
Of you beside me here beneath the blue  
My dream of love is coming true  
Within our desert caravan!

"I'm gonna love you, like nobody's loved you  
Come rain or come shine  
High as a mountain, deep as a river  
Come rain or come shine  
I guess when you met me  
It was just one of those things  
  
But don't you ever bet me  
'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me  
You're gonna love me, like nobody's loved me  
Come rain or come shine  
  
We'll be happy together, unhappy together  
Now won't that be just fine  
The days may be cloudy or sunny  
We're in or out of the money  
But I'm with you always  
I'm with you rain or shine

"Darn that dream I dream each night  
You say you love me and hold me tight  
But when I awake and you're out of sight  
Oh, darn that dream  
  
Darn your lips and darn your eyes  
They lift me high above the moonlit sky  
Then I tumble out of paradise  
Oh, darn that dream  
  
Darn that one-track mind of mine  
I can't understand that you don't care  
Just to change the mood I'm in  
I'd welcome a nice old nightmare  
  
Darn that dream and bless it too  
Without that dream I never have you  
But it haunts me and it won't come true  
Oh, darn that dream

"Daydream, why do you haunt me so  
Deep in a rosy glow  
The face of my love you show  
  
Daydream, I walk along on air  
Building a castle there  
For me and my love to share  
  
Don't know the time, lordy  
I'm in a daze  
Sun in the sky, while I moon around, feeling, hazy  
  
Daydream, don't break my reverie  
Until I find that he,  
Is daydreaming just like me  
  
Daydreams, why do you haunt me so  
While I'm in this rosy glow  
Bring back my love  
Bring back my love  
Bring back my love

"Do nothing till you hear from me  
Pay no attention to what's said  
Why one should tear the seam of anyone's dream  
Is over my head  
  
Do nothing till you hear from me  
At least consider our romance  
If you should take the word of others you've heard  
I haven't a chance  
  
True, I've been seen with someone new  
But does that mean that I'm untrue?  
While we're apart, the words in my heart  
Reveal how I feel about you  
  
Some kiss may cloud my memory  
And other arms may hold a thrill  
But please do nothing till you hear it from me  
And you never will!

"Why are my eyes always full of this vision of you  
Why do I dream silly dreams that I fear won't come true  
I long to show you the stars  
Caught in the dark of the sea  
I long to speak of my love but you don't come to me  
So I go on asking if maybe one day you'll care  
I tell my sad little dreams to the soft evening air  
I am quite hopeless it seems, two things I know how to do  
One is to dream  
Two is loving you

"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time  
In thinking such a thing could be  
That you could ever care for me  
I'm sure you hate to hear  
  
That I adore you, dear  
But grant me  
Just the same  
I'm not entirely to blame  
  
For love  
You'd be so easy to love  
So easy to idolize  
All others above  
  
So worth the yearning for  
So swell to keep every home fire burning for  
We'd be so grand at the game  
So carefree together  
  
That it does seem a shame  
That you can't see  
Your future with me  
'Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love

"I love you for sentimental reasons  
I hope you do believe me

I think of you every morning  
Dream of you every night  
Darling, I'm never lonely  
Whenever you are in sight

Someday soon, we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Until then, we'll have to muddle through, somehow  
  
And have yourself a merry little Christmas, now

",Ellie Goulding
"You wake up and you know it's time to go  
With spending heads I lie on what you smoke  
Chase the hands on the wall, can hold you close  
This misery is weightless as a stone  
  
Have you lost the scendings I have lost?  
Do you know that panic I know?  
Would I see the terror in your eyes  
Did you know that fever I know?  
I wish time was still  
We'd stay right here  
With time to keep in our hearts without chains  
  
And if time was still  
We'd have no fear, or scars to heal  
In our hearts without chains  
In our hearts without chains

",Ellie Goulding
"You know it, it is only true  
That you could be the best of you  
How I wonder miles away  
Tying horshoes by the bay  
  
As we know, maybe faster  
All the way down to El Paso  
  
Many say and lucky do  
My own fire once said it too  
Leave the ocean live and play  
Door on sockets yesterday  
  
As we know, maybe faster  
All the way down to El Paso  
  
Is it fair or nestled sorrow  
You could be there tomorrow  
  
As we know, maybe faster  
All the way down to El Paso  
  
Whooo...  
  
Whooo...  
  
As we know, maybe faster  
All the way down to El Paso

"Born to lose  
I've lived my life in vain  
Every dream has only brought me pain  
All my life I've always been so blue  
Born to lose  
And now I'm losing you  
  
Born to lose  
Oh it seems so hard to bear  
When I wake and find that you're not there  
Ooh you've grown tired and now you say we're through  
I'm born to lose  
And now I'm losing you  
  
Born to lose  
I've lived my life in vain  
Every dream has only brought me pain  
All my life I've always been so blue

Born to lose  
And now Elton I'm losing you

"They're writing songs of love, but not for me  
A lucky star's above, but not for me  
With love to lead the way, I've found more clouds are gray  
Than any Russian play could guarantee  
  
I was a fool to fall and get that way  
High ho, alas, and also lack-a-day  
Although I can't dismiss the memory of her kiss  
I guess she's not for me  
  
It all began so well, but what an end  
This is the time a feller needs a friend  
When every happy plot ends with a marriage knot  
And there's no knot for me

",Elton John
"I used to know this old scarecrow  
He was my song  
My joy and sorrow,  
Cast alone between the furrows  
Of a field no longer sown by anyone.  
I held a dandelion  
That said the time had come  
To leave upon the wind  
Not to return  
When summer burned the earth again.  
  
Cultivate the freshest flower  
This garden ever grew,  
Beneath these branches  
I once wrote such childish words for you.  
But that's okay,  
There's treasure children always seek to find,  
And just like us  
You must have had  
A once a upon a time.

",Elton John
"I hope the day will be a lighter highway  
For friends are found on every road  
Can you ever think of any better way  
For the lost and weary travelers to go?  
  
Making friends for the world to see  
Let the people know you got what you need  
With a friend at hand you will see the light  
If your friends are there, then everything's all right  
  
It seems to me a crime that we should age  
These fragile times should never slip us by  
A time you never can or shall erase  
As friends together watch their childhood fly

"Jo-Jo was a man who thought he was a loner  
But he knew it couldn't last

Get back to where you once belonged  
Get back, get back  
Get back to where you once belonged

From a strange craft

I am your robot, man  
I am your robot, I am your robot  
I am your robot, man

I've been stumbling around like a metal man  
On the graveyard shift  
  
I am your robot, and I'm programmed to love you

"She was just seventeen  
And you know what I mean  
And the way she looked was way beyond compare  
I couldn't dance with another  
When I saw her standing there  
Well she looked at me  
And I could see  
That before too long I fell in love with her  
I couldn't dance with another  
When I saw here standing there  
Well my heart went boom  
As I crossed that room  
And I held her hand in mine  
Oh we danced through the night  
And we held each other tight  
And before too long I feel in love with her  
I couldn't dance with another  
When I saw here standing there

"If I'm frightened then I can hide it  
If I'm crying, I'll call it laughter  
If I am haunted, I'll call it my imaginary friend  
If I am bleeding I'll call it wine  
  
But if you leave me then I am broken  
And If I'm broken then only death remains  
  
If I am drifting, then I can fight it  
If I am sinking, no-one will know it  
If I am blinded I'll have my voices to guide me  
If they yet fled away I'd bless the silence  
  
But if you leave me then I'm broken  
And If I'm broken then only death remains

"I marvel at the wonder of it in our soulless age  
Fast flow the tears upon the page  
Don't be alarmed I am her friend  
Will I be excused if I presume  
It's more than disappointment that we share  
You share the same sorry life, the families fight,  
That unhappy blade you both invite  
This romantic ideal has a lonely appeal  
I once loved someone the way that you do  
But I had to let her go  
I live with my regret  
Don't despair my would-be Juliet

",Elvis Costello
"Why must I be so lonely?  
When so many people pass me by  
I've been waiting for oh so long now  
And yet I'm unable to answer why  
I can't be made to give up now  
Can you find room for me  
In your heart somehow?  
I wanna be loved  
I just wanna be loved  
  
I guess I'm a victim of loneliness  
But why should this be my destiny?  
A foolish man for a lot of my life  
Shouldn't there be someone  
Someone for me?  
I hope and I pray some happy day  
That I'll be around to hear you say  
I wanna be loved  
I just wanna be loved

"Hello misfortune, how's my old friend ""Mr. Misery""?  
I've been away so long I bet you think you saw the last of me  
Got no bed, to rest my head  
No doors or walls or window pane  
Now all I needed was the rain  
Rain, rain, rain, rain  
  
Met a little honey at the ""Buzzin' Bumble Bee Cafe""  
Yes I did  
One drink and all my money and that honey bee had flown away  
I'm 'bout as low, as I can go  
I don't really mean to complain

I kept a ribbon from your hair  
A breath of perfume lingers there  
It helps to cheer me when I'm blue  
Anything that's part of you  
  
Oh, how it hurts to miss you so  
When I know you don't love me anymore  
To go on needing you  
Knowing you don't need me

When I'd give all of someone new  
For anything that's part of you?

All the love I knew  
  
Oh how much it hurts me now

Love is like a dying ember  
Only memories remain  
Through the ages i remember  
Blue eyes crying in the rain  
  
Someday when we meet up yonder  
We'll stroll hand in hand again  
In a land that knows no parting

Of broken dreams from lovin' someone in vain  
Like I loved you, and baby I still do  
  
I held you so tight  
You were out of my sight  
I'm feelin' so low

For something you need

I'll be your baby tonight.

We're gonna forget it.  
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon,  
But we're gonna let it,  
You won't regret it.  
  
Kick your shoes off, do not fear,  
Bring that bottle over here.  
I'll be your baby tonight.

"There's a picture that I carry  
One we made sometime ago  
When they ask who's in the picture with me  
I say just someone I use to know  
Just someone I use to spend some time with  
Just a flame that lost its glow  
And I don't tell them how lost I am without you  
I say just someone I use to know  
Just someone I use to run around with  
Just a friend from long ago  
I don't tell them all the nights I cry without you  
I say just someone I use to know  
I say just someone I use to know

One that love you and give you warning  
Now you find that you been misused,  
Well how many girls can think all right  
  
She'd embarrass you anywhere,  
She'd make her friends think that she didn't care  
Give me the chance and I'd been begging  
And I just want to take care of you and I want you to  
  
Tell Mama, all about it, tell Mama, what you need  
Tell Mama, what you want and how that girl does things all right  
Let me hear you say

For you to cry. We've been through this before  
In every time, in every season,  
God knows I've tried  
So please don't ask for more.  
  
Can't you see it in my eyes  
This might be our last goodbye  
  
Carrie, Carrie, things they change my friend  
Carrie, Carrie, maybe we'll meet again  
  
I read your mind, with no intentions  
Of being unkind, I wish I could explain  
It all takes time, a whole lot of patience  
If it's a crime, how come I feel no pain.

That no one can ever reprise  
  
I never knew the charm of spring  
I never met it face to face  
I never knew my heart could sing  
I never missed a warm embrace  
  
Till April in Paris  
Whom can I run to?  
What have you done to my heart?

"Are you lonesome tonight, do you miss me tonight, are you sorry we drifted
apart?  
Does your memory stray to a bright summer day  
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart.  
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare  
Do you gaze at your doorstep, and picture me there  
  
Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again  
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight  
Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again  
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?

"Around the world I've searched for you  
I traveled on when hope was gone to keep a rendezvous  
I knew somewhere, sometime, somehow  
You'd look at me and I would see the smile you're smiling now  
  
It might have been in County Down  
Or in New York, in gay Paree , or even London town  
No more will I go all around the world  
For I have found my world in you

"As you desire me, so shall I come to you,  
Howe'er you wander, so shall I be,  
Be it forever, or be it just a day,  
As you desire me, come what may.  
I doubt not but you will do what you will with me,  
I give my life to you 'cause you're my destiny.  
And now, come take me, my soul is yours.  
As you desire me, I come to you.  
And now, come take me, my very soul is yours,  
As you desire me, I come to you.

"Blue lace, her gown was blue lace,  
She wore the promise of springtime and laughter.  
Daybreak, we talked till daybreak  
Without a warning of what might come after.  
  
Her touch was velvet, I still can feel it  
That one brief moment that ended in space.  
Sometime in mid-December,  
I hear the music, the echo of springtime laughter,  
  
All day I see the old days,  
When I'd seen the young girls in blue, blue lace.  
Her gown was blue lace, such lovely blue lace,  
Her gown was blue.

"What can I say to you, Bonita, what magic words would capture you

Shall I be the clown for you, Bonita, I will be anything you say.

That has this heart of mine so a flame?  
Tell me, Catana, what heaven gave you your eyes?  
What elfin fiddler plays for your sighs?  
Fashioned of Venus, that is your form and your face  
Two clinging vines for arms, hold me in tender embrace

Each word opposes all else but love

"Singing carols, stringing popcorn  
Making footprints in the snow  
Memories, Christmas memories  
They're the sweetest ones I know  
Cookies baking in the kitchen  
Cards and ribbons everywhere  
Frosty, Christmas memories  
Float like snowflakes in the air  
And oh, the joy of waking Christmas mornings  
The family round the tree  
We had a way of making Christmas morning  
As merry as can be  
I close my eyes and see shining faces  
Of all the children who now have children of their own  
Funny, but comes December  
And I remember every Christmas I've known

It was just one of those things  
But don't you ever bet me  
'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me  
You're gonna love me, like nobody's loved me  
Come rain or come shine  
We'll be happy together, unhappy together  
Now won't that be just fine  
The days may be cloudy or sunny  
We're in or out of the money  
But I'm with you always  
I'm with you rain or shine

"Crazy love, people say I'm crazy in love.  
Just a fool, sighing sighs to the skies up above  
It isn't normal or real, to feel heaven's right inside your door.  
But somehow that's how I feel, and I've never felt this way before.  
  
Crazy dreams, keep me clinging to this affair.  
I'm insane to keep dreaming that you could care.  
But I am a kind of a fool who stayed after school.  
  
I've learned my lessons well,  
And if this crazy love is such a crazy love, I'm glad I fell.

",Frank Sinatra
"The days of wine and roses laugh and run away like a child at play  
Through the meadow land toward a closing door  
A door marked ""nevermore"" that wasn't there before  
  
The lone-ly night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories  
Of the golden smile that introduced me to  
The days of wine and roses and you

"Sitting in a graveyard  
Waiting for the dawn  
Leaning on my tombstone  
Till the night is gone  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh how the moon  
Hangs in black sky  
Wish I could find out  
The reason why  
I sit here alone  
And cry  
  
My woman was so lovely  
Together we were one  
No sunshine in my weary eyes  
Now that she has gone

Palm trees whisper to me  
From your spreading height  
Tell me all the lonely stories  
Of the world at night

"It's a can of gas-o-line  
Trapped in a s-ink  
And I think...  
Bad things are happen-ing  
And I just happen to think  
That someone's gonna grab it and fling  
It all over the napkins and the flammable rabbit mink  
After they drink  
It's gonna be on of those hazardous things  
Where people just sit back and laugh as it's happening  
I'm trapped by kin  
And hundreds  
Of bungee jumping  
Bad acting friends

You want his love much more than mine  
'Cause I'll just say we've never met  
If I'm that easy to forget.

"Being together as two friends  
This all our love has ever been  
Now even our friendship has gone  
When we're together we're all alone.  
  
Being together to forget  
The ones we loved before we met  
But now their mem'ries linger on  
When we're together we're all alone.  
  
Being together all this time  
With someone else on our mind  
For them our love grew stronger as time went by  
When we're together we're all alone...

"You've stolen my world from under me my cheating end deceving me  
And now you've gone and set me free it's in my book of memories  
Inside the book of pages black with photographs that take me back  
I hide the dreams that used to be here in my book of memories  
The photograph that shows a bride and a man with joy he could not hide  
And one of a boy on his daddy's knee it's in my book of memories  
Inside the book of pages black...

"Born to lose I've lived my life in vein  
Every dream has only brought me pain  
All my life I've always been so blue  
Born to lose and now I'm losing you  
  
Born to lose it seems so hard to bear  
How I long to always have you near  
You've grown tired and now you say we're through  
Born to lose and now I'm losing you  
  
Born to lose my every hope is gone  
It's so hard to face an empty dawn  
You were all the happiness I knew  
Born to lose and now I'm losing you

"CC Waterback one tequila sunrise  
One's for my aching head the other's for my bloodshot eyes  
Last night I let it all hang out I guess that's how my head got sore  
CC Waterback I can't stand the pain no more  
  
Last night we got invited to a party at the Jones' place  
For fun and games and booze and things I guess I must drunk a case  
But that lady of mine drank warm red wine til she couldn't even find the door  
She wound up on the Jones' bed and I wound up on the floor

"I heard the front door closin' softly  
As I waken from my sleep  
With the last touch of her lips, Lord  
Like a whisper on my cheek.  
  
And I curse the sun for risin'  
For the worse Lord, is yet to come  
Cause this mornin' she's just leavin'  
But come sundown she'll be gone.  
  
See the lipstick on the pillow  
That I placed beneath her head  
And the soft sheets still feel warm, Lord  
Where she lay upon my bed.

For the hurt Lord, has just begun

To get those big bad car keys

Leads me to your door.

Some big men might live with misery

It's for sure it's gonna take a lot bigger man than me

There dwells a maid with a heart so mellow  
Soft as the wind and wild as the sea

Nor poems of love no rhymes to bring her

Must fly before the cold October winds

And the long hard wind will blow  
May this world find a resting place

Now our love is a memory  
Where it's gone nobody knows  
But I'll hold so dear as a souvenir  
Just a petal from a faded rose  
(I will live with the roses Where the sea of memory flows)  
And each time I dream then a tear will gleam  
On this petal from a faded rose

"Beyond the reef where the sea is dark and cold  
My love has gone and my dreams grow old  
There'll be no tears there'll be no regretting will she remember me will she
forget  
I'll send a thousand flowers where the trade winds blow  
I'll send my lonely heart for I love her so  
Someday I know she'll come back again to me  
Till then my heart will be beyond the reef  
I'll send a thousand flowers

"Tonight I'm blue for old Hawaii my weary sould is lonesome too  
She left me blue and broken hearted I've got them old Hawaii blues  
(Your big blue eyes and darkbrown curls dear made skies of grey turn into blue  
But now you've gone and lost forever I've got them old Hawaii blues)  
You left me down where drowsy waters roll on the shores of paradise  
You've had your way dear and we have parted for you old pal I dream tonight  
Perhaps some day your mind will wander back to the one who loves you true  
And I will still for you be waiting I've got them old Hawaii blues

"The stars shine down on me only  
The moon is pale  
I search in vain  
For love on the lonely trail.  
  
I'm a blue ranger  
But my heart's in danger  
Would you bide awhile  
Or ride a mile along with me.  
  
On the lone prairie,  
Things were so contrary  
Love was in the air  
But none would share it's song with me.  
  
A moonlit trail  
A starlit sky above  
I cried a lonesome wail  
In search of love...

"Blue rose of the Rio I can see her now  
As she looked that day when I rode away through a golden dawn  
It was there by the Rio that we made our vows  
Then we kissed goodbye what a fool was I fore I traveled on  
I should have known as we kissed such heaven as this could only be  
Paradise's lost if it would tossed away so free  
Must I wish for manana that will never come true  
Blue rose of the Rio my answer is you

In this cold world  
There's nothing for me now  
Won't you hear my only plea  
And bury me deep  
Where the sun doesn't shine  
Because sunshine I've never known  
Dig down deep where the ground is cold  
Dark and cold and all alone

Only love I knew  
And tonight I find I can't have you  
Trouble and tears are all that I see  
Now you are gone please hear my plea  
Bury me deep where the sun...

I kneel close to my darling's side,  
Her eyes in death forever closed,  
My sweet and future bride.  
  
Beside some lonely river bank,  
Where the weeping willow grow,  
I'll ease my aching heart tonight,  
Down where the dark waters flow.  
  
I planted on her new made grave  
A tender rose with care,  
To bloom through' all the lonely years  
While she is lying there.  
  
I'll place one tender kiss of love  
Upon that budding rose,  
And bid my world of cares goodbye  
Down where the dark waters flow.

At his whisper birds start singing  
When my heart needs melodies  
  
Why I strayed from all his goodness  
My poor mind can't understand

I lost hold of his hands  
  
Those hands that gave me mercy  
When I'm wrong as wrong can be  
If they really gave me justice  
I'd be lost on homeless sea

In search of his hands

So always make me wonder always make me guess

Just let it remain me your secret but darling I love you so

He bade me look the other way I saw a man I heard him say  
He said if I'd be lifted up I'll draw all men to me  
He turned and then I saw the nail scared hands that bled for me  
  
(I touched the hem of his garment that fell round him there)  
My life my heart I gave my soul was in his care  
  
When I awoke my heart beat sore and in the dark I saw a glow  
It was no dream he turned my way again I heard my Saviour say  
He said if I'd be lifted up...

I uttered a sigh then whispered goodbye goodbye to my happiness  
Your mother was crying your father was crying and I was crying too  
The teardrops were falling because we were losing you

Loving you and knowing you were untrue  
It's over now and I'm so glad

A thousand times my poor soul died

How can you turn away from his side

How can you refuse Jesus now

As they nailed his hands he cried they don't understand  
As the blood flowed from his side  
How can you refuse him now...

To find a life that's new

A jug of wine to numb my mind  
But what good does it do  
The jug runs dry and still I cry  
I can't escape from you.  
  
These wasted tears are souvenirs  
Of a love I thought was true  
Your memory is chained to me

That dreams will soon come true

The moon just went behind the clouds  
To hide its face and cry.

When leaves begin to die  
That means he's lost the will to live,

Lights up a purple sky.

Too many broken vows and promises

Ends with a the marriage knot

Heard they crowded the floor  
Couldn't bear it without you  
Don't get around much anymore  
  
Thought I'd visit the club  
Got as far as the door  
They'd have asked me about you  
Don't get around much anymore  
  
Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease  
But nevertheless, why stir up memories  
  
Been invited on dates  
Might have gone but what for  
Awfully different without you  
Don't get around much anymore

"He is good  
They are happy  
He is strong  
They are secure  
He is right  
They are unquestioning  
He is wrong  
They are demure  
  
When she left  
He was tortured  
She was gone  
They were confused  
He was forgetful  
They were supportive  
He was funny  
They were amused  
  
He did things that only superman could do  
Things that sis and I could not believe were true  
  
He is older  
They are loving  
He is hardened  
They are grown  
He is needing  
They are giving  
He is glad they are his own

"Step aside  
Step aside  
The krewe's gonna take a ride  
Better stand behind the barricade  
Here comes, here comes, here comes  
The big parade  
  
So make way  
So make way  
That's what the captain say  
Down st. Charles and esplanade  
Here comes  
The big parade  
  
""throw me somethin mister""  
I wanna dance with your sister  
Brass bands marchin by  
Throwing notes to the sky  
  
There goes

Second-liners and flambeaus

Than the day was made  
Here comes  
Here comes

"I wonder as I wander, out under the sky  
How Jesus the savior, did come to die  
To save lowly people like you and like I  
I wonder as I wander, out under the sky  
  
Sweet Mary laid Jesus, within a cow's stall  
Came wise men and farmers and shepherds and all  
The blessings of Christmas heaven did fall  
And God's promise of ages, to them did recall  
  
If Jesus had wanted for any small thing  
A cloud in the sky or a bird on the wing  
Or all of God's angels in heaven to sing  
He surely could have had it, because  
He was the King  
Because He was King!

","Harry Connick, Jr."
"It's time to admit you love me  
The flush of your cheek betrays  
I hear a sigh in your voice  
Your every word conveys  
  
It's time to admit you love me  
I feel the weight of your gaze  
The smile that's mine alone  
Your starry eyes sparkle ablaze  
  
It's such a simple thing  
How hard can it be  
These few words  
Endear you to me  
  
It's time to admit I love you  
And lift the worry from your brow  
Rest your head upon my shoulder  
There's nothing to be afraid of now

","Harry Connick, Jr."
"O little town of Bethlehem  
How still we see thee lie  
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep  
The silent stars go by  
  
Yet in they dark streets shineth  
The everlasting light  
The hopes and fears of all the years  
Are met in thee tonight  
  
For Christ is born of Mary  
And gathered all above  
While mortals sleep the angels keep  
Their watch of wondering love  
  
O morning starts together  
Proclaim thy holy birth  
And praises sing to God the King  
And peace to men on earth

"Maybe far away, or maybe real near by.  
He may be pouring her coffee,  
She may be Straightening his tie.  
Maybe in a house all hidden by a hill,  
She's sitting playing Piano,  
He's sitting paying a bill.  
  
Betcha they're young.  
Betcha they're smart,  
Bet they collect things like ashtrays and art.  
Betcha there good.  
Why shouldn't they be?  
Their one mistake was giving up me.  
  
So maybe now it's time,  
And maybe when I wake,  
They'll be there calling me baby,  
Maybe.

We looked at each other in the same way then  
But I can't remember where or when

The smile you are smiling you were smiling then  
But I can't remember where or when

And laughed before and loved before

Leaving today  
Cool night, mellow light

Stay one more day

Friend there will never be a friend  
As dear to me as You  
There will never be another  
Closer than a brother  
Friend always worth the wait  
Faithful as the day

You know all about me  
The good and the bad  
You know when I rise and fall  
  
You see my beginning  
You stand at the end  
And yet You remain  
Faithful to say I'm Your friend

I receive Your healing  
Everytime You call me friend

"Ribuan kilo jalan yang kau tempuh

Walau tapak kaki, penuh darah... Penuh nanah  
  
Seperti udara... Kasih yang engkau berikan  
Tak mampu ku membalas... Ibu... Ibu  
  
Ingin kudekat dan menangis di pangkuanmu  
Sampai aku tertidur, bagai masa kecil dulu  
Lalu doa-doa baluri sekujur tubuhku  
Dengan apa membalas... Ibu... Ibu....

"I'm a moody and swirling pool, lost in some dark wood  
Angry at a million things and more  
I can do no good  
Ah, but sometimes -  
  
Sometimes I'm a growing blade of grass  
Washed by the rain, bent by the wind  
  
I'm a deeply wounded lonely tree  
Lost in my own way  
Brooding on the saddest things and worse  
I've seen my better day  
  
I'm an old and broken tumbleweed  
Lost on faded sands  
Dreaming of my yesterdays before  
I watch the heat waves dance

"Well the stage was set, the sun was sinking lowdown  
As they came to town to face another showdown  
The lawmen cleared the people from the street  
All you blood thirsty bystanders, will you try to find your seat  
  
Watch 'em duelin', Doolin-Dalton  
High or low its all the same  
Easy money an' faithless women  
You will never kill the pain  
  
Go down Bill Doolin don't you wonder why  
Sooner or later we all have to die  
Sooner or later that's a stone cold fact  
Four men ride out and only three ride back

"I'm here at Fourth and Main  
Been standing in the rain  
I feel no joy, I feel no pain  
I got nothing to lose, nothing to gain  
I'm at Fourth and Main  
Been down at City Hall  
Been writing on the wall  
The grass is wet and the trees are tall  
I listen to the pigeons, to the raindrops fall  
I'm at City Hall  
Been down at Pershing Square  
I can't seem to care  
If the people stop or the people stare  
I don't care if I'm leaving, I'm going somewhere

Bring them from the darkness  
Let the minutes and hours  
Show my mind strange new flowers  
But I'd like to know where they go  
when the morning comes  
Bring my dreams to me  
  
Because it seems to me  
That there may never be  
A better chance to see who I am  
Come timelessly dancing  
Through my dreams to me

"We see him dancing in the morning  
Stars depart the yawning sky  
He'll take the hour that is passing  
And leave it in his lover's eye  
And if you want he'll make it seem  
As though you're walking in his dream  
A mystic sea  
  
We hear him laughing in the shadows  
As he smuggles in the sand  
He's found another kind of color  
In the magic he has donned  
And if you want he'll take the time  
To ask the sun and moon to rhyme  
And then combine  
He draws no lines between what he's imagining

At the twilights last gleaming?

O'er the ramparts we watched  
Were so gallantly streaming?  
And the rocket's red glare!

And for once...and for everyone...

Love called to all...music is magic.  
As we passed over and beyond the walls of nay.  
Hand in hand as we lived and  
Made real the dreams of peaceful men--  
  
We came together...danced with  
The pearls of rainy weather  
Riding the waves of music and  
Space--music is magic...  
Magic is life...  
Love as never loved before...  
Harmony to son and daughter...man and wife.

"Today I passed you on the street and my heart fell at your feet  
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you  
Somebody else stood by your side and he looked so satisfied  
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you  
  
A picture from the past came slowly stealing  
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you  
Then suddenly, I got that old time feeling  
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you  
  
It's hard to know, another's lips will kiss you  
And hold you just the way I used to do  
Oh, Heaven only knows how much I miss you

",Johnny Cash
"I will miss you when you go much more than you'll ever know  
But I'll have a memory to keep you near  
  
In my heart you will remain but it just won't be the same  
I will miss a million things that make you dear  
  
Your lovely ways make you so sweet I prayed the angels fair will keep  
You're happiness so you'll be blessed just as you deserve to be  
  
I wonder why there are so few lovely people like you  
My but I will surely miss you when you go  
  
Your lovely ways make you

",Johnny Cash
"I took a house by the water  
Took a man on a mountainside  
Pretty house by the water  
Lovely lover by the waterside  
Last time I saw that man  
He hung down his head and cried  
  
Corrina, Corrina  
Do you have to go  
Corrina, Corrina  
Tell me why do you have to go  
Just made me come to love you girl  
Now you pack your things and go  
Leave me this bird that whistles  
Leave me this bird that sings  
  
I got a bird that whistles  
I got a bird that's singin'  
If I don't have you darlin'  
Birds don't mean nothin'

"Don't worry 'bout me  
I'll get along  
Forget about me  
Just be happy my love  
  
Let's say that our little show is over  
And so the story ends  
Why not call it a day the sensible way  
And still be friends  
  
Look out for yourself  
That should be the rule  
Give your heart and your love  
To whomever you love  
Darlin' don't be a fool  
  
Why do we cling to this old faded thing  
That used to be  
So if you can forget  
Then you don't worry 'bout me

",Joni Mitchell
"Deep in my Heart I love you  
Deep in my heart I care  
You are my life  
My everything, my dream, my every prayer  
  
Deep in my heart I know  
That deep in your heart you know  
That we were meant for each other  
And we will love each other forever  
  
Deep in my heart I know  
That deep in your heart you know  
That we were meant for each other  
  
And deep within my heart  
And deep in your heart  
Yes we will love each other forever  
Deep in my heart forever

"Hush now baby don't you cry  
Rest your wings my butterfly  
Peace will come to you in time  
And I will sing this lullaby  
No though I must leave, my child  
But I would stay here by your side  
And if you wake before I'm gone  
Remember this sweet lullaby  
And all love through darkness  
Don't you ever stop believing  
With love forlorn  
With love you'll find your way  
My love  
The world has turned the day to dark  
I leave this night with heavy heart  
When I return to dry your eyes  
I will send this lullaby  
Yes I will send this lullaby

"Wash away the thoughts inside  
That keep my mind away from you  
No more love and no more pride  
And thoughts are all I have to do  
  
Remember when it rained  
I felt the ground and look up high  
And called your name  
Remember when it rained  
In the darkness I remain  
  
Tears of hope run down my skin  
Tears for you that will not dry  
They magnify the one within  
And let the outside slowly die  
  
Remember when it rained  
I felt the ground and looked up high  
And called your name  
Remember when it rained  
In the water I remain  
  
Running down

"Oh baby, your face is dark, and your eyes are wild.  
Oh baby, you look to me as if you're still a child.  
  
Your innocence to me is so hard to believe,  
Just a spell in my past, tell me, how long will you last.  
  
Oh baby, you stole my lonely heart for you.  
Oh baby, I want to tell you what you can do.  
  
I no longer care about the things we shared, you always had your way.  
Won't you find a place today, won't you find a place to stay(repeat).

Girl, your lips touching mine  
Ooh so fine  
Girl, softly touching me  
Ooh so fine

"Who are the ones that slip and slide through life,  
Moving like the waves in a sink,  
People, always need a minute or two to think.  
  
Who says they're not going to Hell,  
Climbing the stairway to you know where,  
People, Oh! so happy until they scare.  
  
Who always has got to talk about somebody else,  
Born as a God, they think that's got to be  
People, simply just another you and me.

Under the Main Street light  
Ridin' slow  
  
This ol' town, ain't the same  
Now nobody knows his name  
Times have changed, still he rides.  
  
Traffic lights, keepin' time  
Leading the wild and restless  
Through the night

Still they ride, on wheels of fire  
They rule the night  
Still they ride, the strong will survive

'Round and 'round  
And 'round and 'round

"When you're looking at life,  
In a strange new room,  
Maybe drowning soon,  
Is this the start of it all?  
Turn on your TV,  
Turn down your pulse,  
Turn away from it all,  
It's all getting too much.  
  
When you're looking at life,  
Deciphering scars,  
Just who fooled who,  
Sit still in their cars,  
The lights look bright,  
When you reach outside,  
Time for one last ride,  
Before the end of it all.

"Caressing the marble and stone,  
Love that was special for one,  
The waste in the fever I heat,  
How I wish you were here with me now.  
  
Body that curls in and dies,  
And shares that awful daylight,  
Warm like a dog round your feet,  
How I wish you were here with me now.

Cord stretches tight then it breaks,  
Someday we will die in your dreams,  
How I wish we were here with you now.

Searched hard for you and your special ways.

Took threats and abuse 'till I'd learned the part.  
Can you stay for these days?

Used outward deception to get away,  
Broken heart romance to make it pay.

Take care of it all now these debts are paid.

Since I found someone who would stay

I get weary,  
And sick of trying I'm tired of living,  
But scared of dying,  
That old man river,  
He just keeps rolling along.

"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high  
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.  
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue  
And the dreams that you dare to dream,  
Really do come true.  
  
Someday I'll wish upon a star  
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.  
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,  
High above the chimney tops,  
That's where you'll find me.  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly  
Birds fly over the rainbow  
Why then, oh why can't I?  
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow  
Why, oh why can't I?

"All night long he calls her snookey ookum, snookey ookums.  
All they do is talk like babies.  
She's his jelly elly roll.  
He's her sugey ugar bowl.  
Hear the way they bill and coo, poogywoo,poogywoo, poogywoo?  
All night long he calls her snookey ookums, snookey ookums.

"If you never had to count  
A million cheap,  
Then youve never been blue,  
Never been blue.  
If youve never had to cry  
Yourself to sleep,  
Then youve never been blue,  
Never been blue.  
I know I could go on laughing at trouble,  
Plain trouble,  
But when it concerns my heart  
The pain seems double.  
Oh, no one ever knows what I go through,  
While someone at home is babying you.  
If you never had to miss a good night kiss,  
Then youve never, no, youve never been blue.

Thought my life was through  
'Til the heavens opened

Won't you tell me, dear  
Why, when you appear,  
Something happens to me  
And the strangest feeling goes through me?  
  
You do something to me  
Something that simply mystifies me  
Tell me, why should it be,  
You have the power to hypnotize me?  
  
Let me live 'neath your spell  
Do do that voodoo that you do so well  
For you do something to me  
That nobody else could do

But there were times, Dear, you made me feel so bad  
  
You made me sigh for, I didn't want to tell you  
I didn't want to tell you  
I want some love that's true, yes I do, deed I do, you know I do

We stood beneath an amber moon

With still a million things to say

Recalling thrills of our love  
There's one thing I'm certain of  
  
Return I will

And it's yours and it's mine  
Like the sun, and at the end of the day  
We should give thanks and pray  
To the one, oh, to the one.

"Would you like to dance?  
Not very good, I'll admit it  
I just need a minute or two  
Close your eyes, cos  
  
I can't believe your eyes  
Wild and blue, warm and willing  
I can't believe your eyes  
Is it true what they're saying?  
  
Women come and go  
So many occasions I have to look twice  
To catch your second show  
One look at you, that's all I needed tonight, 'cos  
  
I can't believe your '  
  
Don't stop, the music playing  
Don't wanna lose it tonight  
Now that we got that feeling  
So good, so right

Didn't you know'.  
  
I remember too  
A distant bell and stars that fell like rain  
Out of the blue.

And the angels ask me to recall

They come and they go  
It seems I've forgotten what I need to know  
I feel I'm wasting time at night when I sleep  
  
Someone so shallow that's in so deep  
So I patch the holes that yet haven't appeared  
Completely blinded but things are so clear  
I know just what to do but why the fuck should I bother  
  
I'm content sitting at the right hand of our father  
Fuckin' A is all I got to say  
Give me peace of mind and I'll be on my way  
I was born into this world and I don't know why  
So all I'm doing's passing time before I die

"Written by todd rundgren  
Some people don't seem real at all  
Unafraid of any mountain  
Sure that the gods won't let him fall  
Should he fall, he will always get up again  
And if he's hurt he never shows it  
If he's wrong nobody knows it  
Seems like he never has to try  
He just must be a lucky guy  
And when there's pain he never minds it  
When it's lost he always finds it  
Nobody really knows just why  
He just must be a lucky guy  
He just must be a lucky guy  
I wish I was that lucky guy

Walking on air  
  
And the worries of the day lie down  
Under cover of the fading clouds  
The secrets of the night

You don't have to try

Warmer than may her tender sighs

Like a flame burning brightly

Were so gallantly streaming.

For the land of the free, and the home of the brave.

And I could always  
Come to her  
She can't imagine how  
Another lover  
Could turn her head  
And I'm so grateful  
That I'm still willing  
To have her home  
She says she loves me  
She won't forget me  
And then she's gone  
She thinks that later  
We can pick up the pieces  
And carry on  
And I'd forgive her  
Still not suspecting  
She could be wrong  
Now I'm so grateful  
I'm no longer willing  
To have her home  
Now I'm so grateful  
I'm no longer willing  
To have her home

"I come to the garden alone while the dew is still on the roses  
And the voice I hear falling on my ear the son of God discloses  
And he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me I am his own  
And the joy we share as we tarry there none other has ever known  
  
He speaks and the sound of his voice is so sweet that the birds hush their
singing  
And the melody that he gave to me within my heart is ringing  
And he walks with me

"Is it wrong for loving you is it wrong for being true  
Tell me darling tell me please is it wrong  
Have I waited for so long has your love for me gone  
Is it wrong is it wrong for loving you  
  
Way down deep inside my heart you're the only love sweetheart  
Yes the only true love I ever knew  
But I ask myself inside no need telling myself lies  
Is it wrong is it wrong for loving you  
[ piano - steel ]  
Is it wrong for loving you..

"Many heartaches have passed since we met  
There's a kind that a heart can't forget  
And the sweet memories are too few  
While I'm living my lifetime for you  
I'm living my life for you  
You're living to break me in two  
I'd die while you're being untrue  
Still I'm living my lifetime for you  
[ guitar ]  
If ever there should come a time  
When you feel that you'd like to die  
Well you've made me feel that way too  
But I'm living my lifetime for you  
I'm living my life for you...

"I've seen him as he awakens in the morning  
He reaches out his hand and without a word  
As his fingers softly fall upon my face  
He lights the flame of desire and makes me want him.  
  
Chorus:  
Love is the foundation we lean on and all you need is love to ease your mind.  
It doesn't have to be right to be called love  
When he gives me more lovin' that a lifetime of looking could ever find.

"You put a halo and wings around me now you say that I have gone bad  
But while you were busy with business and booze  
I lost the wings and the halo I had  
You say I went from a saint to a sinner but you can't blame me for it all  
You were the teacher I was just a beginner you don't know how it hurt me to
fall  
[ piano - steel ]  
You didn't think that your angel could wander but I'm just like you flesh and
blood  
While you had your drinkin' your buddies and business  
I guess I had too much time all alone  
You say I went...

"Satin sheets to lie on satin pillows to cry on  
But still I'm not happy don't you see  
Big long Cadillacs pretty clothes upon my back  
But still I want you to set you free  
I found another man who can give me more than you can  
So you've given everything that money can buy  
But your money can't hold me tight like he does on a long long night  
No you didn't keep me satisfied  
Satin sheets to lie on...  
Oh but still I want you to set you free

"Once I had a secret love that lived within the heart of me  
All too soon my secret love became impatient to be free  
So I told a friendly star the way that dreamers often do  
Just how wonderful you are and why I'm so in love with you  
Now I shout it from the highest hills even told the golden daffodils  
And now my heart's an open door and my secret love's no secret anymore  
Now I shout it from the highest hills

"Silver bells silver bells it's Christmas time in the city  
Ring a ling hear them ring soon it will be Christmas Day  
City sidewalks busy sidewalks dressed in holiday style  
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas  
  
Children laughing people passing meeting smile after smile  
And on every street corner you hear  
Silver bells silver bells...  
  
(Silver bells) silver bells (silver bells)  
Silver bells soon it will be Christmas Day

"Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling calling for you and for me  
See on the portal he's waiting and watching watching for you and for me  
Come home come home ye who are weary come home  
Earnestly tenderly Jesus is calling calling oh sinner come home  
  
Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading pleading for you and for me  
Why should we linger and heed not his mercies mercies for you and for me  
Come home come home

There is no forgiving  
Paralyzed I lay here sleeping  
Quiet as a little child  
Heart starts beating  
Blood rushing pounding  
Moving quiet as a little lamb

Limbs are bound devoid of movement  
The injuries we do in kind  
Are visited upon us often

Trying hard to move a shadow  
Don't bury me I'm still alive

Be my own for the rest of my days

To my city by the bay

To be where little cable cars

Above the blue and windy sea

But your lips deny they're true,  
Will your answer really change things  
Making me blue?  
  
I'm afraid some day you'll leave me,  
Saying ""can't we still be friends""  
If you go, you know you'll grieve me,

Am I guessin' that you love me,  
Dreaming dreams of you in vain,  
I'm confessin' that I love you, over again.

Through the doorway of Heaven

When you press me to your heart  
I'm in a world apart

Everyday words seem to turn into love songs  
  
Give your heart and soul to me  
And life will always be la vie en rose.

Reaching for someone else's hand  
What we share is magic  
Heaven had a plan  
  
[Chorus]  
Sent from up above  
So much love  
In my life  
I can't get enough  
Of your touch-feels so right  
Unending passion  
Somehow the fire never dies  
  
What we share  
Is everlasting  
Love without without demise  
He made it happen  
  
Placed so much joy into our hands  
What we dreamed  
We finally captured  
Heaven took command

"The wild mountain thyme that grows around my door  
Has grown there for two score years or more  
And I've grown weary waiting for love to say  
""Come my way, come my way.""  
  
The brook that sings and twinkles in the sun  
Has danced this mercy dance since time begun  
But o how weary and how long the day will he say  
""Come my way.""  
  
Lovers all around, I wish you joy  
Happiness to every girl and boy.  
But sometimes spare a thought of me and say  
""Love come her way,"" come my way.

That was almost the end of my marbles  
Confiscated, I choked back the tears  
I hung onto a handful of favourites  
That disappeared over the years  
  
Did anyone see my last marble  
I swear that I had it before  
Sometimes I think I should go see a shrink  
In case he can find me some more  
  
Did anyone see my last marble?

Since I was a youth

Only words  
Only words  
Only words.

Seem suddenly boring  
When I look in her eyes  
All the world is behind  
  
Every line on her face  
Is a place and a memory  
When our fingers touch  
All the years fall away  
  
Mistakes that she made  
Are lessons she carries  
And still she's prepared  
To tell me she'll stay  
  
She's older than me  
She's shown me the heaven  
And we're gonna be over the hill  
And far away...

Wearing bracelets of smoke, naked of understanding  
Nicotine smears, long, long dried tears, invisible tears  
Safe in my own words, learning from my own words  
Cruel joke, cruel joke  
Huddled in the safety of a pseudo silk kimono  
A morning mare rides, in the starless shutters of my eyes  
The spirit of a misplaced childhood is rising to speak his mind  
To this orphan of heartbreak, disillusioned and scarred  
A refugee, refugee.

And we make love

"This Christmas season I wish you joy  
The wonder in every girl and boy  
I wish you gladness, the one [Incomprehensible]  
Have good friends and family gathered near  
May children's laughter in falling snow  
Rekindle those sweet scenes from long ago  
May every carol, each candle bright  
Remind you why angels sang that night  
If trouble finds you, this is my prayer  
May peace come into your hearts and make you strong  
And I wish you luck, the kind to last all year long

"Away in a manger, no crib for a bed  
The little Lord Jesus  
Laid down his sweet head  
The stars in the sky  
Look down where he lay  
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay  
  
The cattle are lowing  
Poor baby awakes  
The little Lord Jesus  
No crying he makes  
I love the Lord Jesus  
Look down from the sky  
And stay by my craddle  
Till morning is nigh  
  
Be near me Lord Jesus  
I ask thee to stay  
Close by me forever  
And love me I pray  
Bless all the dear children  
From thy tender care  
And take us to heaven  
To live with thee there.

In a lowly manger  
He came down to the earth  
Bringing us new birth  
Carols sing to the King  
Jesus Christ our Saviour  
  
Tidings bring! Hail the King!  
Shepherds did adore Him  
From afar, by the star  
Wise men sought and found Him  
Son of God, Son of Man

Carols raise His name praise  
He shall reign eternally

Genlty and lowly, lived below

Where the angels fill the sky  
And I believe we'll live forever

Will never die

Snow on snow on snow  
In the bleak midwinter  
Long, long ago  
What can I give him?  
Poor as I am  
If I were a shepherd  
I would bring a lamb  
If I were a wise man  
I would do my part  
Yet what I can, I give him  
Give my heart  
Snow had fallen, snow on snow  
Snow on snow on snow  
In the bleak midwinter  
Long, long ago

"Breathe deep the gathering gloom,  
Watch lights fade from every room.  
Bedsitter people look back and lament,  
Another day's useless energy spent.  
Impassioned lovers wrestle as one,  
Lonely man cries for love and has none.  
New mother picks up and suckles her son,  
Senior citizens wish they were young.  
Cold hearted orb that rules the night,  
Removes the colours from our sight.  
Red is grey and yellow white,  
But we decide which is right.  
And which is an illusion?

"On Lover's Island  
Where the trees stand so tall  
And the dust turn to gold  
And love never grows old  
  
On Lover's Island  
Where the birds sing of love  
Seems a gift from up above  
I met her one day  
(Met her one day)  
  
As we stood alone on the mountain  
Under the moon and stars above  
Oh, darling, don't ever go  
She was Venus, the goddess of love  
  
On Lover's Island  
Where the trees stand so tall  
And the dust turn to gold  
And love never, never  
Never, never grows old

"Say what you mean, mean what you say  
Say what you mean, mean what you say  
  
Let's walk into the forest  
Only witnessed by the moon  
And the breeze that once would chill us  
Now excites  
Say what you mean, mean what you say  
And we'll touch the secret places  
As the earth beneath us breathes  
And the raw exquisite ecstasy  
Rushes in  
  
Say what you mean, mean what you say  
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

"Cold hearted orb that rules the night  
Removes the colors from our sight  
Red is gray and yellow white  
But we decide which is right  
And which is an illusion  
  
Pinprick holes in a colorless sky  
Let insipid figures of light pass by  
The mighty light of ten thousand suns  
Challenges infinity and is soon gone  
  
Nighttime to some, a brief interlude  
To others the fear of solitude  
Brave Helios, wake up your steeds  
Bring the warmth the countryside needs

",Moody Blues
"When the white eagle of the North is flying overhead  
The browns, reds and golds of autumn lie in the gutter, dead.  
Remember then, that summer birds with wings of fire flaying  
Came to witness springs new hope, born of leaves decaying.  
Just as new life will come from death, love will come at leisure.  
Love of love, love of life and giving without measure  
Gives in return a wondrous yearn of a promise almost seen.  
Live hand-in-hand and together we'll stand on the threshold of a dream.

"When the sun goes down,  
And the clouds all frown,  
Night has begun for the sunset.  
See it with your eyes,  
Earth re-energized  
By the sun's rays every day.  
Take a look out there,  
Planets everywhere.  
When the sun goes down  
And the clouds all frown,  
Night has begun for the sunset.  
Shadows on the ground  
Never make a sound,  
Fading away in the sunset.  
Night has now become  
Day for everyone.  
  
I can see it all  
From this great height.  
I can feel the sun  
Slipping out of sight  
And the world still goes on  
Through the night.

"What child is this, who, laid to rest  
On Mary's lap, is sleeping?  
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet  
While shepherds watch are keeping

Whom shepherds guard and angels sing  
Haste, haste to bring him laud  
The babe, the son of Mary

Television show  
You spoke in silhouette  
(But they couldn't name you)  
Although the panel were  
Very polite to you  
But I remembered you  
Friday nights 1969  
ATV - you murdered every line  
Too old to be a child star  
Too young to take leads  
Four seasons passed  
And they axed you  
Nervous juvenile  
(Won't smile! )  
What became of you?  
Did that swift eclipse torture you?  
A star at eighteen  
And then-suddenly gone  
Down to a few lines  
In the back page of a faded annual  
Oh but I remembered you  
I remembered you.

Your tired family grieving  
And you think they're sad because you're leaving  
But did you see jealousy in the eyes  
Of the ones who had to stay behind  
And do you think you've made  
The right decision this time

Your girlfriend on the platform  
With this really ragged notion that you'll return

He really goes

Will come to you

Although there are a thousand things that house may need  
  
The carpet may be old, the room so plain and bare  
And yet it's beautiful somehow when love is living there  
  
A house with love in it just seems to bloom  
As though the month of may were filling every room  
  
So darling true the years with all my heart I'll pray

"There was a boy  
A very strange enchanted boy  
They say he wandered very far, very far  
Over land and sea  
A little shy and sad of eye  
But very wise was he  
  
And then one day  
A magic day he passed my way  
And while we spoke of many things  
Fools and kings  
This he said to me  
""The greatest thing you'll ever learn  
Is just to love and be loved in return""

"Never let me go  
Love me much too much  
If you let me go  
Life will lose its touch  
What would I be without you?  
There's no place for me without you  
  
Never let me go  
I'd be so lost if you went away  
There'd be a thousand hours in a day without you  
I know  
  
Because of one caress my world was overturned  
at the very start  
All my bridges burned by my flaming heart  
You'd never leave me would you?  
You couldn't hurt me could you?  
  
Never let me go  
Never let me go

"Night lights, those blues-in-the-night lights  
Are no longer bright lights since I'm without you  
Sweet dreams, oh where did they fly to?  
You're gone and who can I cry to?  
  
Those night lights remind me of bright eyes  
And beautiful white lies too good to be true  
As I go on my way with all my heart I pray  
That those night lights will lead me to you

Close to the lips that adore you  
And even though it's time to go

So come to my arms,  
We?re young but we?ll learn

Can never return  
How sad is the truth?try though we may

"O holy night!  
The stars are brightly shining,  
It is the night  
Of the dear Saviour's birth  
Long lay the world  
In sin and error pining  
Till He appeared  
And the Soul felt its worth  
A thrill of hope  
The weary soul rejoices,  
For yonder breaks  
A new and glorious morn  
Fall on your knees!  
Oh, hear the angel voices!  
O night divine,  
O night when Christ was born  
O night, O holy night,  
O night divine!

O night when Christ was born

Our meetings are few and over too soon!  
We speak in a whisper afraid to be heard  
When people are near, we speak not a word!  
  
Alone in our secret together we sigh  
For one smiling day to be free!  
  
To kiss in the sunlight and say to the sky  
Behold and believe what you see,  
Behold how my lover loves me!

I mean, look at you now, hoe, you just tragic!  
You a tragedy, you a parody

"Trees have dropped their leaves,  
Clouds their waters  
All this burden is killing me  
  
Distance is covering your way,  
Tears your memory  
All this beauty is killing me  
  
Oh, do you care,  
I still feel for you  
So aware,  
What should be lost is there  
  
I fear I will never find anyone  
I know my greatest pain is yet to come  
Will we find each other in the dark  
My long lost love

This painting with me  
Unveiling of me,  
The magician that never failed  
  
This deep sigh  
Cover all my chest  
Intoxicated by  
A major chord  
  
I wonder do I love you?  
  
Slow love slow  
Only the weak  
Are not lonely  
  
Southern blue  
Morning dew  
Let down your guards  
I love you

Lips to ear rhymes  
A slumber deeper than time

Only the weak  
Are not lonely

Slow slow hum hooo hum huuuuum

"All those beautiful people  
I want to have them all  
All those porcelain models  
If only I could make them fall  
  
Be my heart a well of love  
Flowing free so far above  
  
A wintry eve  
Once upon a tale  
An Ugly Duckling  
Lost in a verse  
Of a sparrows carol  
Dreaming the stars  
  
Be my heart a well of love  
Flowing free so far above  
  
In my world  
Love is for poets  
Never the famous balcony scene  
Just a dying faith  
On the heaven's gate  
  
Crystal pond awaits the lorn  
Tonight another morn for the lonely one is born

Let my soul rest in peace

My soul has roamed the earth  
In search for you  
So that someday I could give birth  
  
To know joy, joy, joy, joy  
Joy and peace is mine  
Peace divine  
And now we give thanks  
Give thanks for each other  
At peace forever  
For it is done  
  
At peace forever  
For we are one

Sometimes the tears will flow.  
Some of my memories will fade,  
But I'll always remember that one September day.  
I used to reminisce  
'Cause I thought that love was bliss.  
How did they know it would go astray?  
It began, and it ended on one September day.  
We met by chance,  
As people often do,  
But it blossomed, yes, it blossomed  
Into something I never knew.  
Now... It is in the past.  
They said it would never last.  
I'll not forget the moment back,  
Nor hot May or December,  
Nor June or November,  
But one September day.

How can I go on  
Was our love a game played for a day  
Were you pretending two hearts gone astray  
Am I to blame for this unhappy ending

Beloved how I long to hold you in my arms enfold you  
Live again out happiness but now I can face tomorrow alone

Why isn't the waltz entrancing

Spring is here  
Why doesn't the breeze delight me

Why doesn't the night invite me  
But maybe it's because nobody loves me  
Spring is here I hear  
Somebody told me spring is here

Blood on the leaves and blood at the root,  
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze,  
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.  
  
Pastoral scene of the gallant south,  
Them big bulging eyes and the twisted mouth,  
Scent of magnolias, clean and fresh,  
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh.  
  
Here is fruit for the crows to pluck,  
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck,  
For the sun to rot, for the leaves to drop,  
Here is a strange and bitter crop.

It's so relaxing to hear you're asking wherever you get your way  
It's so soothing to know that you'll sue me, this is starting to sound the

"Charlie brown says  
No-one promised this when i was a kid  
When my days were filled with carousels  
Fairground rides and cockleshells  
Kicking pebbles on a beach  
When time couldn't reach me  
And tears were just a memory left to be learned  
  
Now days catch me without an overcoat  
Five o'clock shoes full of snow  
All rained out, nowhere to go  
  
Memories are sure to find you  
No matter how fast you run  
Gonna catch up with you

At the Royal Bangkok Academy  
And English words  
Are all we speak  
At the Royal Bangkok Academy  
If we pay attention to our teacher  
And obey her every rule,  
We'll be grateful for  
Those golden years  
At our dear old school.

"(Nettie)  
When you walk through a storm  
Keep your chin up high  
And don't be afraid of the dark  
  
When you walk through a storm  
Keep your chin up high  
And don't be afraid of the dark  
At the end of the storm  
Is a golden sky  
And the sweet, silver song of the lark  
  
(Chorus sings with Nettie)  
  
Walk on through the wind  
Walk on through the rain  
Though your dreams be tossed and blown  
Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart  
And you'll never walk alone  
You'll never walk alone

Send it, I pray

Only when you're so far, far away?  
  
Ooh, send me your kisses  
Why don't you send it, my dear  
So I can hold you  
And pretend, yeah, you are here  
  
Why don't you send me your kisses?  
Honey, I can feel that great love  
I need you so bad  
I miss you, you so much

If you just treat her right now  
  
Squeeze her real gentle  
Got to make her feel good  
Tell her that you love her  
Like you know you should  
So if you don't treat her right  
She won't love you tonight

Just as hard as you can

As a loving man

Camouflage with gold  
  
And hey, leave the light on for me  
And hey, leave the light on for me

Can't leave here tonight

The big dumb rocket on your mind

Dreamed about

Or worry about the bills tonight  
I wanted you to know

So bring back the sun  
We'll bury this hate  
And build it with love

The dynamite is waiting  
They bankrupted the sky  
You're frustrated by the cracks in  
The pavement

You'll be there  
When everyone is sane you'll be there

The tension is building but I'm alright  
The stars are colliding, so you might as well let me go  
The television is burning because I set it on fire  
The wheels they keep turning, but I'm fine  
What about the questions we have locked up inside  
Somewhere, somehow  
We've been denied  
Hand in hand we walk behind pretending,  
Defending while our souls are tied  
It's only the third hour, my conscience subsides  
But something reminds me that you lied  
What about the consequences?  
This can't be right

"So you feel that stain of dried up discussions without weight  
It's that feeling you will not have to destroy

The dirty walls  
So you've been plagued, but is everything okay  
I cannot bear the shallow words they throw  
It's that feeling that you will not have to employ  
It's that feeling that you will not

It's transparent as fuck

Was never cool he'll never settle down  
He's not allowed to drive  
He'll build a bridge then walk around  
Don't ever call him dumb he's not that bright  
He's just not himself

And I could be the head laying on your breast

Really meant for you

And I'll meet it with joy

Honored us in the manner  
Of which they lived their lives  
We will never forget them  
As they prepared for their journey  
And waved goodbye  
And they slipped the surly of earth  
To touch the face of God.

I try not to see you  
But you're a great arranger  
No, I don't understand your kind of love

No, I don't understand your kind of love

"If you are sincere  
When you say you don't care  
That our love is just a memory  
If the love that we knew  
Won't bother you  
Darling, you're stronger than me  
  
[CHORUS]  
For if still loving you means I'm weak  
Then I'm weak  
For I still fall apart when we speak  
Or we meet  
If the love that we knew  
Won't bother you  
Darling you're stronger than me  
  
If you can have fun  
With some other one  
With no thought of what used to be  
If it's easy to say  
That it's better this way  
Darlin you're stronger than me

"Oh  
To be  
Not anyone  
Gone  
This maze of being  
Skin  
Oh  
To cry  
Not any cry  
So mournful that  
The dove just laughs  
The steadfast gasps  
  
Oh  
To owe  
Not anyone  
Nothing  
To be  
Not here  
But here  
Forsaking  
Equatorial bliss  
Who walked through  
The callow mist  
Dressed in scraps  
Who walked  
The curve of the world  
Whose bone scraped  
Whose flesh unfurled  
Who grieves not  
Anyone gone  
To greet lame  
The inspired sky  
Amazed to stumble  
Where gods get lost  
Beneath  
The southern cross

"I just don't know what to do tonight,  
My head is aching as I drink and breathe  
Memory falls like cream in my bones, moving on my own.  
  
There must be something I can dream tonight,  
The air is filled with the moves of you,  
All the fire is frozen yet still I have the will, ooh, ah.  
  
Trumpets, violins, I hear them in the distance  
And my skin emits a ray, but I think it's sad, it's much too bad  
That our friends can't be with us today

Must you say goodbye?  
  
All the things that we pursue  
All that we dream  
Are composed as nature knew  
In a feather green

As you light afar  
It is true I heard  
God is where you are

Fills the alleys where men sleep  
Hides the shepherd from the sheep

Holy, holy is his sacrament

High in the heavens, a star shone bright  
While in the manger, a wee baby lay  
Sweetly asleep on a bed of hay

Laid down to sleep in a humble stall

Ever and always I think of Thee

While down in the valley a cruel war rages  
And people forget what a child's life is worth  
  
On the side of a hill, a little cloud weeps  
And waters the grave with its silent tears  
While a soldier cleans and polishes a gun  
That ended a life at the age of seven years

And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten

"Fooled, maybe I'm just being fooled  
Maybe I'll be ridiculed but I adore you  
If I'm fooled, then it's heaven being fooled  
For you taught a heart unschooled to live just for you  
  
Those who act cautious and wise  
Never have stars in their eyes  
If I'm in a fool's paradise  
Keep me there for I don't care  
  
If I'm fooled, and my mind is over-ruled  
Still my heart has not been fooled  
'Cause I'll always love you

",Perry Como
"Here comes more tears to cry  
Here comes more heartaches by  
Here comes my baby back again  
  
Here comes more misery  
Here comes old memories  
Here comes my baby back again  
  
My arms are open wide  
To let more hurt inside  
Here comes my baby back again  
  
She's sorry once again  
Once more I'll understand  
Here comes my baby back again  
  
My arms are open wide  
To let more hurt inside  
Here comes my baby back again  
  
She's sorry once again  
Once more I'll understand  
Here comes my baby back again

"I don't see me in your eyes anymore,  
oh why can't I make them shine as before?  
I don't see you or your heart in your kiss,  
when you should sigh that your mine, you resist!  
  
There was a time life was fine, love was ecstasy  
but now I doubt what the outcome will be!  
I pray you'll say I'm the one you adore  
then I'll see me in your eyes as before!  
  
I pray you'll say I'm the one you adore  
Then I'll see me in your eyes as before!

"I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did!  
I never dreamed it could be,  
Yet there you were, in love with me.  
  
I found your lips close to mine, so I kissed you,  
And you didn't mind it at all!  
When I'm awake, such a break never happens,  
How long can a guy go on dreamin'?  
  
If there's a chance that you care, then please,  
Say you do Baby!  
Say it and make my craziest dream come true.

",Perry Como
"If there is someone lovelier than you  
Then I am blind, a man without a mind  
If there is someone lovelier than you  
  
But no, I'm not blind, my eyes have traveled everywhere  
In hopes that I might find, a creature half so fair  
If there is someone lovelier than you  
By all that's beautiful, such beauty can't be true!  
  
If there is someone lovelier than you  
By all that's beautiful, such beauty can't be true!

"I'm gonna love that girl  
Like she's never been loved before,  
I'm gonna show that girl  
She's the fella that I adore.  
When she's in my arms again,  
Our dreams will all come true,  
The years between might never have been,  
We'll start our lives anew,  
I'm gonna kiss that girl  
Like she's never been kissed before,  
And tho' I miss that girl,  
She's the fella I'm waitin' for  
We'll never part again,  
She'll hold my heart again  
Forever and ever more  
I'm gonna love that girl  
Like she's never been loved before.

"I'm gonna sit right down  
And write myself a letter  
And make believe it came from you  
  
I'm gonna write words so sweet  
They're gonna knock me off my feet  
A lot of kisses on the bottom  
I'll be glad I got them  
  
I'm gonna smile and say  
""I hope you're feelin' better""  
And close with love  
The way you do  
  
I'm gonna sit right down  
And write myself a letter  
And make believe it came from you  
  
I'm gonna sit right down  
And write myself a letter

"Hide your heart from sight,  
Lock your dreams at night,  
It could happen to you!  
Don't count stars or you might stumble,  
Someone drops a sigh and down you tumble  
  
Keep an eye on spring,  
Run when church bells ring,  
It could happen to you!  
All I did was wonder how your arms would be,  
And it happened to me  
  
It could happen to you  
All I did was wonder how your arms would be,  
And it happened to me

"Someone states the obvious  
Someone sneers at all you love  
Someone preaches ugly manners  
excluding some, including me  
This is how I learned to hate rock 'n' roll  
This is how I learned to hate rock 'n' roll  
All feelings blunted, all passion spent  
Everybody does what everybody does  
All the broken promises

"I believe in doing what I can  
In crying when I must  
In laughing when I choose  
  
Hey ho if love were all  
I should be lonely  
  
I believe the more you love a man  
The more you give your trust  
The more you're bound to lose  
Although when shadows fall  
I think if only  
Somebody splendid really needed me  
Someone affectionate and dear  
Chaos would be ended if I knew that he  
Wanted to have me near  
But I believe that since my life began  
The most I've had is just a talent to amuse  
Hey ho if love were all  
Hey ho if love were all

"This is no time for tears  
Though our hearts are bleeding  
One for all and all for one for freedom  
  
A bird flies across the sea  
Free as his brother, where is the freedom  
We've been dreaming of for so long?  
  
Oh, brother, waiting is so long  
Life is soon over, it can't be wrong  
To cast off chains that still bind us  
Let death remind us we can be strong  
  
Sister, don't let me down, please, don't forsake me  
One for all and all for one for freedom, today  
One for all and all for one means freedom, today

"Fools Die  
The lips of the righteous teaches many  
But fools die for want of wisdom  
The rich man's wealth is in the city  
Vexation of the soul is vanity  
Destruction of the poor is their poverty  
The poor man's wealth is in a holy, holy place

Why do you kill your brother  
Then your reward will be the cemetery  
We got to build a better nation  
Clean up, clean up Jah creation  
Or there will be no future for you, you and me

"Some day, when I'm awfully low,  
When the world is cold,  
I will feel a glow just thinking of you...  
And the way you look tonight.  
Oh but you're lovely, with your smile so warm  
And your cheek so soft,  
There is nothing for me but to love you,  
And the way you look tonight.  
With each word your tenderness grows,  
Tearing my fear apart...  
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,  
Touches my foolish heart.  
Lovely ... Never, ever change.  
Keep that breathless charm.  
Won't you please arrange it?  
'Cause I love you  
Just the way you look tonight.

We hope we've been clear and concise.

Don't sit down it's time to dig another one  
  
For long you live and high you fly  
But only if you ride the tide  
And balanced on the biggest wave  
You race towards an early grave

"Corporal Clegg had a wooden leg  
He won it in the war, in 1944.  
Corporal Clegg had a medal too  
In orange, red, and blue  
He found it in the zoo.  
Dear, dear were they really sad for me?  
Dear, dear will they really laugh at me?  
Mrs. Clegg, you must be proud of him.

From Her Majesty the queen

"Alone in the clouds all blue  
Lying on an eiderdown.

But I can you.  
  
Lazing in the foggy dew  
Sitting on a unicorn.  
No fair, you can't hear me

Watching buttercups cup the light  
Sleeping on a dandelion.  
Too much, I won't touch you  
But then I might.

Traveling by telephone.  
Hey ho, here we go

Shade my eyes and I can see you  
White is the light that shines through the dress that you wore  
  
She lay in the shadow of the wave  
Hazy were the visions of her playing  
Sunlight on her eyes but moonshine made her cry every time  
  
Green is the color of her kind  
Quickness of the eye deceives the mind  
Envy is the bond between the hopeful and the damned

Lighter than an eiderdown  
Will she let the weeping willow  
Wind his branches round

Waiting for the velvet bride  
Will the scaly armadillo  
Find me where I'm hiding

Will the key unlock my mind  
Will the following footsteps catch me

I fell on his neck with a scream  
He had a whole lotta  
Terminal shock in his eyes  
That's what you get  
For pretending the rest are not real  
  
Babbling and snapping  
At far away flies  
He will zig zag his way back  
Through memories of boredom and pain

To be empty and angry and spaced?  
Split up the middle  
Between the illusion of safety in numbers  
And the fist in your face

Midnight blue burning gold.  
A yellow moon is growing cold.  
  
I rise, looking through my morning eyes,  
Surprised to find you by my side.  
Rack my brain to try to remember your name  
To find the words to tell you good-bye.

"The black and green scarecrow as everyone knows  
Stood with a bird on his hat and straw everywhere.  
He didn't care.  
He stood in a field where barley grows.  
  
His head did no thinking  
His arms didn't move except when the wind cut up  
Rough and mice ran around on the ground  
He stood in a field where barley grows.  
  
The black and green scarecrow is sadder than me  
But now he's resigned to his fate  
'Cause life's not unkind, he doesn't mind.  
He stood in a field where barley grows.

They hunt us down like carrion crows  
They search us out like frightened moles

An awful waste of guts and gore  
An awful waste of human life  
This senseless, bloody, bitter strife  
We huddled close against the ground  
Scared to make the slightest sound  
And all around the great guns boom  
The constant march of pending doom

All of the credit and none of the blame

She'd left me a note and taken the cat

Could never be broken: it was tied to my heart

Kept them burning to the sky

Were searching for a different tune  
One that they could croon as only they can  
  
They heard the breeze in the trees  
Singing weird melodies  
And they made that the start of the blues  
  
And from a jail came the wail  
Of a down-hearted frail  
And they played that as part of the blues  
  
From a whippoorwill out on a hill  
They took a new note  
Pushed it through a horn till it was worn into a blue note  
  
And then they nursed it, rehearsed it  
And gave out the news  
That the Southland gave birth to the blues

A troubled man but I stand  
  
All my life I have seen what ir means  
To be myself in this dream  
  
'Cause we all need something to do  
A certain someone... That's you

Again baby.

Come back to me again,  
And play your sad guitar.

We kiss, and the angels sing

If she's not something special  
Don't take her from me  
Because she's something special to me  
Can't you see?  
  
If she's not number one  
Every day, till your whole life is done  
Don't take her from me  
  
There is only one for me  
She is all there could ever be  
So don't take her from me

"Today I passed you on the street  
And my heart was at your feet  
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you  
  
Somebody else stood by your side  
And he looked so satisfied  
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you  
  
A memory from the past came slowly stealing  
As I braced your arm and walked so close to you (yeah)

I can't help it if I'm still in love with you  
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

I want the love this life has to give.  
I want to smile and be friendly with you.  
I want to live and let you live some too

Draw your names among their ashes  
Lay your children on their thrones  
Gather 'round and fall right down

Everything is all right

Opening around and let's the garden rise

Where's your surgeon  
Left with your  
Insides open  
Hung your hearts out

Stumbling and wander in the moonshine

Bulging eyes and a twisted mouth  
Send up magnolia, sweet and fresh  
And the sudden smell of burning flesh.

For (but) the rain to gather for the wind to suck  
For the sun to rot for the tree to drop

"The love that you gave me has gone with the rain  
The joy that just filled me has turned into pain  
  
My face in the mirror reminds me of you  
It's the one that you lied to when you said you'd be true  
  
The tears in my eyes are all that you'll find  
The scars on my face just deepen my mind  
  
The love that you gave me has gone with the rain

"A thousand cities in the night  
Each one waiting for the light  
Ten million people plan their day  
As the sun still burns away  
  
As the earth just spins in space  
People plan their daily race  
As the sun still burns away  
Few say ""Thank you for the day""  
All the people in their ties  
Forget to look up at the sky  
they exist another day  
As the sun still burns away

When the final die is cast  
Every day brings forth the time

And my strings were always sharp

I'll be strumming on some angels harp  
  
And if I don't get to heaven  
And I go down there below  
Better be a guitar when I get there  
Or, I will refuse to go

Over the hill  
  
Like a cripple and his crutch  
I have leaned a bit too much  
Seems that I should never touch again  
Now it seems it's plain to see  
That this stuff is killing me

I let mine go long, long time ago, now

Throw my Bible out the window  
As the train goes on i'ts way  
  
Gonna leave my blues behind me  
Gonna find another town  
Gonna try and find some people  
Who this time won't bring me down

The station looks the same  
As the one I left behind me  
Though it has another name

Blacked out and I can't remember exactly what I did last night  
I hear stories in the morning and I know that I'm out of control  
Because wheni drink nothing ever matters,  
I missed the sunrise, could barely open my eyes  
Now I've got to pull myself together  
Right now this town really fucking tears me down  
Someday it will drown me in the river  
I've got to learn to put the liquor on the shelf  
Or I might end up drowning myself.

All I own I would give  
Just to have you adore me  
  
Till the moon deserts the sky  
Till the all the seas run dry  
Till then I'll worship you  
Till the tropic sun turns cold  
Till this young world grows old  
My darling, I'll adore you  
  
You are my reason to live  
All I own I would give  
Just to have you adore me

Till lovers cease to dream.

"And I love you so the people ask me how  
How I've lived till now I tell them I don't know  
I guess they understand how lonely life has been  
But life began again the day you took my hand  
And yes I know how lonely life can be  
The shadows follow me and the night won't set me free  
But I don't let the evenings get me down now that you're around me  
And you love me too your thoughts are just for me  
You set my spirit free I'm happy that you do  
The book of life is brief and once the pages read all but life is dead that is
my belief  
And yes I know...  
And I love you so

"The words I love you come easy to the lips of a liar or a fool  
If love talking is what you're thinking of then do it to someone you love  
Do it to someone you love  
Some little things to let them know they're all you're thinking of  
This day and time a little thing you do could mean so much  
So do it to someone you love  
  
A smile comes easy to a strange hello to someone that you never met  
But an old love don't need that smile it glows with just a touch  
So do it to someone you love  
Do it to someone you love...

"There's a place called Da Nang Village cross the ocean far away  
In deep concern for one young woman that's where I abide today  
Today I got a dear-John-letter from that young woman in the USA  
  
When I was called I knew I'd lose her it don't matter anyway  
There are girls in Saigon City waiting there with open arms  
On my leave I may go see them in this other world called VietNam  
  
Stateside girls should take this warning be faithful cause you can't tell  
On the streets of Saigon City they have many things to sell

"I love little baby ducks, old pickup trucks  
Slow-movin' trains and rain  
I love little country streams, sleep without dreams  
Sunday school in May and hay  
And I love you, too  
  
I love leaves in the wind, pictures of my friends  
Birds of the world and squirrels  
I love coffee in a cup, little fuzzy pups  
Bourbon in a glass, and grass.  
And I love you, too  
  
I love honest, open smiles, kisses from a child  
Tomatoes on the vine and onions

You feel bad next day when you do  
And leave on a light when you're home alone at night  
I still care what happens to you  
I guess I shouldn't be concerned  
I guess I still haven't learned

How can you know love when no one ever knew  
It's the mother of all happiness and father of the blues  
Love puts sunshine in your days, then steals your sleep at night  
It's one of the mysteries of life  
  
Maybe you should take it day by day  
If you hold love too loosely, it will fly away  
If you hold love too tightly, it will die  
It's one of the mysteries of life

"Memories light the corners of my mind  
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were  
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind  
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were  
  
Can it be that it was all so simple then  
Or has time rewritten every line  
If we had the chance to do it all again  
Tell me, would we?  
Could we?  
  
Memories may be beautiful and yet  
What's too painful to remember  
We simply choose to forget  
So it's the laughter we will remember  
Whenever we remember  
The way we were  
The way we were

Swirling in neverending harmony  
They glisten as they decent,  
Sparkling like diamonds all the way

Where the treetops glisten,  
and children listen  
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

May your days be merry and bright  
And may all your Christmases be white

"Where will I wander and wonder  
Nobody knows  
But wherever I'm a-going I'll go  
In search of a rose  
  
Whatever the will of the weather  
And whether it shines or snows  
Wherever I'm a-going I'll go  
In search of a rose  
  
I don't know where it's found  
I don't mind  
As long as the world spins around  
I'll take my time  
  
I'll savour the softness of summer  
I'll wrap up when winter blows  
And wherever I'm going I'll go  
In search of a rose

"I stood upon the balcony with my brand new bride  
The clink of bells came drifting down the mountainside  
When in our sight something moved  
Lightning eyed and cloven hoofed,  
The great god Pan is alive!  
  
He moves amid the modern world in disguise  
It's possible to look into his immortal eyes  
He's like a man you'd meet anyplace  
Until you recognize that ancient face  
The great god Pan is alive!  
  
At sea on a ship in a thunder storm  
On the very night that Christ was born  
A sailor heard from overhead  
A mighty voice cry

"I'm too tired to deceive you  
We can't pretend there's nothing wrong  
Who'll be first to say it?  
That the thrill is gone  
And we never get it back  
When we talk of old acquaintance and  
Speak like two strangers all day long  
The only four words that I hear  
Are: the thrill is gone  
And we never get it back  
When evening fall Magenta  
And goodnight hangs on and on  
I won't need to go to sleep and dream  
To tell me  
That the thrill is gone  
And we never get it back

I'll jump off and smile back at you

Felt just like falling down on my knees to pray.  
Looked at myself, and all that I could say  
Was,""I think I see the errors of my way"".  
  
There in the glass there was something caught my eye,  
Although I try through my sighing not to cry.  
See where I am, and what I try to say,  
Just so I'll look at the errors of my way.  
  
Guess I got no one around to pull me through.  
I just need someone to turn to, yes, I do.  
Doin' my best just to change my yesterday,

Turmoil has turned you inside  
Sift through your pages of miracles you wish to find  
  
[Chorus]  
When you're too numb to cry  
And you're just left wondering why  
When you're too numb to cry  
And you're just left wondering why  
  
To change in the blink of an eye  
If you could you surely would wave yourself goodbye  
I try and I try and I try  
Get a hold on your suffering  
Peace in which you don't wish to buy

",Zakk Wylde
"2, 3, 4, 1, drank all my fuckin' brew  
And I ain't got's no more  
Feeling so damn tired  
Running on desperate fumes  
For the end is always near, now  
Empty handed it's always soon  
Psychocise me, terrify me  
Jeopardizing all that's mine  
Megolamize me, certify me  
On my knees until I cry  
Lord only knows where I've gone  
Lord only knows where I've been  
In a world of trouble again worries  
Streaming 'round the bend  
Treat me like a dog, now  
Knowing I won't turn  
Blind me like a slave, now  
Cast down no concern  

",Zakk Wylde
"Dear Tiffany,  
You've mad me nauseous for the last time  
Everything I've said to you, I will form a spike (to drive through my  
throat) In order to stop my words  
This time I'll put them in the ground along with my memories and my feelings  
I'll burn it down and walk away  
Let the fire warm my back  
I wish you would say you hate me  
It would make it so much easier  
Burn it down and walk away,  
Love Daniel

"Your eyes  
Your eyes  
Your eyes search for me  
Your eyes search for me  
Your eyes search for me  
Your eyes search for me  
Your eyes  
Your eyes search for me  
  
For so long I've wanted to come home  
Held back by lies of serpents and tongues of brothers  
Turning a child into an enemy  
Turning open arms into closed fists  
  
I could see the reflection in the tears  
That made their way down Your face  
Onto the ground I kneel upon  
They form a river that overtakes me  
Compassion envelops me  
I forgive and release  
Forgive, release  
Forgiven, released

",Zao
"We march like fools in the parade of chaos.  
We march like fools in the parade of chaos.  
Led by our enemies.  
While we sing there praises.  
Led by our enemies.  
While we kiss their hands.  
The morning rained fire.  
Let heavens retire.  
Over the eyes of the blind.  
And the voices of spoiled children.  
True leaders are gone.  
We turned our backs to many times.  
And bit the hand of the provider.  
Chaos kills us.  
Chaos
