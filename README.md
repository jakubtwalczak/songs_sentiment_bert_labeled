# Songs' sentiment - BERT labeled

Processing text data with BERT models for further, conventional processing.

# Project's description

This project's goal is to use pretrained language models to assign continuous features and labels to short (300-600 signs) songs' lyrics, visualize and analyze continuous data and try to check if the traditional text classifiers are comparable efficient.

# Technologies used

- The file is written in Python (version 3.10.6).
- Main library used - Transformers to implement BERT-based algorithms,
- Other used libraries are described in requirements.

# Installation

Write the command below:
```bash
python setup.py install
```
or
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

in command prompt.
